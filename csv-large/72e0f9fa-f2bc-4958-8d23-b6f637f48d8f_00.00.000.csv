The plants are used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime.;OTHER DATA:;{{children_only_technology}}; - Average efficiency: {{efficiency}}; - Share of installed capacity with desulfurisation 2% (rough estimation based on sulfur mass balance; - Average efficiency of desulfurisation installations: 92% (rough estimation based on Dones et al. 27; - Share of installed capacity with denitrification (primary and/or secondary installations): 73% (figure based on IEA 212 ); - Average efficiency of denitrification installations: 8% (estimation based on Dones et al. 27, p.128.
