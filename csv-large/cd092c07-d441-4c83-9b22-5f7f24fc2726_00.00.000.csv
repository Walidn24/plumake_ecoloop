In this process, a solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate leaches metallic copper in the presence of air. The leaching step involves three reaction steps, of which the first one is very slow compared to the following two steps. Therefore, only a continuous operation of the plant achieves good results. After the leaching step, several filtering and stripping steps are carried out before the copper(II) oxide can be dryied and packed. The used ammonia and carbon dioxide are recovered in the strip tank and go back to the starting point.;The overall reaction of the hydrometallurgical production of copper(II)oxide can be summarized out of the following two reaction steps (leaching and stripping):;4 Cu + O2 + 4 NH3 + 2 (NH4)2CO3 → 2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + 2 H2O;2 Cu2(NH3)4CO3 + O2 → 4 CuO + 8 NH3 + 2 CO2;The overall process yield is assumed to be 98%. The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal waste water treatment plant assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Reference:;Zhang, J. and Richardson, H. W. 2016. Copper Compounds.
