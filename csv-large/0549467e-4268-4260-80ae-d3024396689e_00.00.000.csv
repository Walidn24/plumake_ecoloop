The process of opencast lignite mining is simple and varies little.Two to six times the amount of lignite is mined as spoil during lignite mine operation.;;Originally bucket-chain dredgers were used, which from its design principle are constructed as building site dredgers, but from its capacity they represent large machines with a spoil mining capacity of about 40 Mio m3/a. Nowadays, conveyor bridges are used in mining areas with smaller depths (up to 60 meteres) and intact, mostly horizontal seams. With conveyor bridges spoil is mined at the borehole top and backfilled at the tail immediately. Conveyor bridges show lengths between 200 and 600 meters and are able to mine up to 130 Mio m3 spoil per year. Stope mining is used for mining areas with greater depths or with difficult geological conditions. Stope mining represents a system with bucket-wheel excavator, conveyor and stacker where the overburden is removed stepwise. With the bucket-wheel excavator spoil is mined, which then is transported to the stacker over long distances. The stacker is very important for land recultivation and landscaping. Recultivation and landscaping is only partially possible with conveyor bridges. However, conveyor bridges are three times cheaper and energy-saving than stope mining. Therefore conveyor bridges are used wherever possible. ;;Due to the difficult geological conditions and partially hard overburden, in Ptolemais, Greece (Gross 1988) systems with power shovel, crusher, tripper car and power shovel/lorry are used.;;Depending on the system coal is transported to mine-mouth power plants or converting factories by conveyors, trains or lorries. In Germany, coal is not treated. In Greece, coal is pre-dried before combustion in mine-mouth power plants to increase the low heat value (below 5 MJ/kg). No information about treatment in Spain or former Yugoslavia was available. ;;References:;Steinmetz R.
