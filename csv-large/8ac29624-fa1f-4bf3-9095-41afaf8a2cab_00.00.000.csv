The first step, at a temperature of 450 to 510°C and a pressure of 0.3 Mpa, uses a hydrogen : carbon ratio of 9:1. The whole process uses a platinum catalyst (0.8 wt%) on alumina, activated by adding lithium, arsenic or germanium. The resulting paraffin-olefin mixture is then separated in the second process, using molecular sieves, absorbing olefins more strongely.;;;Ethylene oligomerization: Two different methods are mainly used for the production of n-olefins out of ethylene: the SHOP (Shell’s higher olefin process) or the Ziegler reaction.  ;For the dataset it is assumed based on literature sources that both ways have a similar yield and the relation n-paraffins to ethylene for the synthesis of n-olefins is of 35% to 65%. ;References:;Behr (2000)",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1995-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
