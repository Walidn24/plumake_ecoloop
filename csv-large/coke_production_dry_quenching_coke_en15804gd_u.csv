Instead of using water, the hot coke is rapidly cooled by circulating an inert gas, such as nitrogen or recycled flue gas, in a sealed chamber. Dry quenching offers benefits such as improved energy efficiency, reduced water consumption, minimized emissions, and enhanced coke quality. It allows for higher production rates, reduces the risk of coke breakage, and is particularly suitable for larger-scale coke plants.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat; Fuels,2013-01-01,2024-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
