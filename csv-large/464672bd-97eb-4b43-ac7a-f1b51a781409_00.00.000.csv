The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 -> Mg + Cl2.;After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.;According to Gao et al. (2018), the chlorination step (2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2) requires 1620 kg of chlorine per metric ton of titanium sponge to compensate for the chlorine that is not recovered by the electrolysis of magnesium chloride. Based on stoichiometry, roughly 2962 kg of Cl2 are required to produce 1 metric ton of titanium sponge. This means the overall recovery rate of Cl is roughly 45%.;Because 0.093 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, this means that 3.885 kg of MgCl2 per kg Ti are sent to electrolysis, out of which 1.342 kg of Cl are recovered. The amount of Cl recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.3455 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 46.4% in this step.;Based on the stoichiometric reaction of the reduction and distillation step, roughly 1.016 kg of Mg are required as input. Gao et al. (2018) report an input of 41 kg per metric ton of titanium sponge. The overall recovery rate of Mg is therefore approximately 96%.;0.97 kg of Mg is recovered out of the 3.885 kg of MgCl2 that goes to electrolysis. The amount of Mg recovered per kg of MgCl2 entering the electrolysis step is therefore 0.2509 kg and corresponds to a recovery rate of 98.3% in this step.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
