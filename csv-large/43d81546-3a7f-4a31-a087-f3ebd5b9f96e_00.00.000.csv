This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'aluminium removed by turning, average, conventional', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is delivering the service of 'aluminium removed by turning, average, conventional'. Turning is a chipping process where the piece of material is rotating while the cutting tool is not. It can be applied to both inside and outside of the piece to be machined and it is normally used to produce cylindrical shapes. It is performed in metals, wood and plastic materials. The process is conventional, meaning that it is controlled manually and needs constant supervision. This dataset represents the turning of 1 kg of aluminium. The service includes materials input, production infrastructure, machinery and electricity consumption. Degreasing is not included and has to be added if necessary.

This activity starts with the service generation.


This activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Metals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
