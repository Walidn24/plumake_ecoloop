The stoichiometric equation is the following; ZrSiO4 ,(HfSiO4 ) + 4 Cl2 + 4 C → ZrCl4 + SiCl4 ,(HfCl4 ) + 4 CO. Afterwards, the bundle product is condensed to remove silicon tetrachloride, since it condenses to higher temperatures than Zr-Hf tetrachlorides. The bundled Zr-Hf product condenses and enters the Zr-Hf separation process. ;The composition of the bundled product is assumed to be 98.4% ZrCl4 and 1.6% HfCl4. In the extractive distillation process, a counter flow technique with a column of molten salt is utilized for the separation of the chlorides. During 1 hour of operation, 23405.1 kg of bundled Zr-Hf tetrachlorides enter the molten-salt-based column (consisting of NaCl and KCl with 8:29 M) from the top. The bundled chloride dissolve creating a molten salt system (34.0 mol% NaCl and KCl (8:29 M); 66.0 mol% ZrCl4 and HfCl4). From the top of the column the solvents are circulated to the bottom, while the zirconium-hafnium chloride fumes follow the opposite direction. The rising fumes are progressively enriched in hafnium chlorides and are extracted from the top of the column (distillate stream) while the flow going down is enriched producing nuclear-grade zirconium tetrachlorides, which are condensed and extracted from the bottom stream.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
