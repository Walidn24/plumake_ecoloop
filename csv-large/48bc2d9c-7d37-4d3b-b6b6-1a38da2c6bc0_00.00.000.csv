This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'aluminium oxide, metallurgical', in the Global geography.;This activity represents the market for 1kg of aluminium oxide, metallurgical. The distances were calculated using the total alumina transport for both Söderberg and prebake electrolysis (in tkm/t liquid aluminium), the amount of alumina (t/t aluminium) and the relative production volume of Söderberg and prebake electrolysis.;[This dataset is meant to replace the following datasets:]

The activity starts at the factory gate with the product ready for transport.

The activity ends with the product delivered to the consumer.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals; Chemicals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
