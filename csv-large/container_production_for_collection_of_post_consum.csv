The functional unit of this activity is the production of a container, with the unit defined based on the typical material requirements for the collection of 1 kg of post-consumer waste plastic for recycling. The underlying data was obtained from PET Recycling Schweiz and this inventory represents the average material requirements over different types of single-way and reusable container types/systems. The inventory only represents a rough estmation of the manufacturing process.

Activity starts with the production of the container for the collection of post-consumer waste plastic packaging material intended for recycling.

This activity ends with the waste material generated by the container at the end of service. Neither losses during production, use and disposal nor infrastructure requirements have been included due to lack of data.
