Ultimate average landfill height is 15 meters. Operation phase duration is 25 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.005145 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.004273 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 100w%. Leachate of the landfill is not treated, but emitted untreated. Leachate flow is upward to the surface due to net negative infiltration. No leachate treatment can be performed. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 6681 years after waste deposition. Arid conditions at this location prompt formation of evaporites from landfill contents which are partially eroded by wind. It is assumed that 10% of these evaporites are eroded by wind and airborne. Initial decay in the first 100 years of this waste results in a wind erosion rate corresponding to 184.4 g/m2.year and long-term decay corresponds to wind erosion of 24.69 g/m2.year.
