In the refiner chamber, single or double revolving disks are used to mechanically pulp the softened chips into fibres suitable for making the board.;From the refiners, the fibres move to the drying and blending area. A rotary predryer may be used for initial drying of relatively wet furnish. Regardless of whether or not a predryer is used, tube dryers typically are used to reduce the moisture content of the fibres to desired levels. Single-stage or multiple-stage tube drying systems are commonly used in MDF manufacture. Most of the multiple-stage tube drying systems incorporate two stages. In multiple-stage tube dryers, there is a primary tube dryer and a second stage tube dryer in series separated by an emission point such as a cyclonic collector. Heat is usually provided to tube dryers by the direct firing of propane, natural gas, or distillate oil or by indirect heating.;The sequence of the drying and blending operations depends on the method by which resins and other additives are blended with the fibres. Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins are the most common resins used in the manufacture of MDF. Phenolic resins, melamine resins, and isocyanates are also used. Some plants inject resins into a short-retention blender, while most facilities inject resin formulations into a blowline system. If resin is added in a separate blender, the fibres are first dried and separated from the gas stream by a fibre recovery cyclone, then conveyed to the blender. The fibres then are blended with resin, wax, and any other additives and conveyed to a dry fibre storage bin.;If a blowline system is used, the fibres are first blended with resin, wax, and other additives in a blowline, which is a duct that discharges the resinated fibres to the dryer. After drying, the fibres are separated from the gas stream by a fibre recovery cyclone and then conveyed to a dry fibre storage bin.;Air conveys the resinated fibres from the dry storage bin to the forming machine, where they are deposited on a continuously moving screen system. The continuously formed mat must be pre-pressed before being loaded into the hot press. After prepressing, some pretrimming is done. The trimmed material is collected and recycled to the forming machine.;The prepressed and trimmed mats then are transferred to the hot press. The press applies heat and pressure to activate the resin and bond the fibres into a solid panel. The mat may be pressed in a continuous hot press, or the precompressed mat may be cut by a flying cut-off saw into individual mats that are then loaded into a multi-opening, batch-type hot press. Steam or hot oil heating of the press platens is common in European MDF plants. After pressing, the boards are cooled, sanded, trimmed, and sawed to final dimensions. The boards may also be painted or laminated. Finally, the finished product is packaged for shipment.",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
