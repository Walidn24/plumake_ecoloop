Water and admixtures will be stored in tanks.;;Inert raw materials namely fine aggregates and coarse aggregates will be stored in bins, whereas cement will be stored in air-tight silos. Water and admixtures will be stored in tanks. Inert raw materials will be fed to the batching plant mixer by means of an aggregate belt conveyor. The required quantity of cement will be extracted from the silo by a screw conveyor and fed into the mixer. Water and admixtures will be pumped into the mixer through a flow meter. After the mixing in the mixer completely, the ready mixed concrete will be discharged into the transmit mixer which can be then transported the concrete to the construction site. All these above operations will be controlled by a computer housed in the control room of the batching plant.",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete,2014-04-01,2023-12-31,India,ecoinvent Data Quality System
