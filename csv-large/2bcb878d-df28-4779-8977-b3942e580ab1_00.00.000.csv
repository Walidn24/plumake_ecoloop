Notably, several variations exist for producing chlorosulfonic acid, with their main difference being the manner of bringing the twa raw materials into contact along with the cooling system of the reactor.;Reaction:;HCl + SO3 â†’ ClSO3H;One configuration comprise of a packed column synthesis reactor with a chlorosulfuric acid spray at the top and hydrogen chloride and sulfur trioxide entering at the bottom. In this case, the reaction and the heat removal both take place in one piece of equipment. Alternatively, it is possible to separate these steps by first mixing the components intensively in a separate mixer such as a mixing nozzle; the hot reaction product is then quickly cooled with cold chlorosulfuric acid in a packed column or other suitable unit. Cooling has also been suggested by means of a water-cooled condenser. In one modification of the process, the first product is chlorosulfuric acid which contains a small excess of sulfur trioxide; this is then cooled and saturated with hydrogen chloride in a bubble column. The off-gas is normally scrubbed, first with 98 % sulfuric acid and then with water.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed. At the same time, any unreacted hydrochloric acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide.;References:;Joachim Maas/fritz Baunack: Chlorosulfuric Acid. Published online: 2000.
