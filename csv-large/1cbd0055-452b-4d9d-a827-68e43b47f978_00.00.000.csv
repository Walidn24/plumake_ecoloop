This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, 1400kW thermal, building', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, building, with a thermal output of  1,400kW. The infrastructure is automatically supplied with wood chips, using a steam turbine and a multi-cyclone filter, while it has a lifetime of 80 years. The floor area of the power plant building is assumed to be 1600 m2. The process includes building materials, their decommission and land use. 

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat; Electricity",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
