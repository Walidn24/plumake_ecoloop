In the second step, these esters are hydrolized for the production of isopropanol. The overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;3 CH3CHCH2 + 2 H2SO4 → (CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2;(CH3)2CHOSO3H + [(CH3)2CHO]SO2  ⎯ H2O → 3 (CH3)2CHOH + 2H2SO4;For this indirect hydration reaction weak or strong acid can be used. While in this process a 60% acid solution is used at about 75-85°C and 0.6-1 MPa, the strong-acid process uses a >90% acid solution at 20-30°C and 1-1.2 Pa. The main advantage of the weak-acid process is the fact that this process can use low-purity propylene feed. On the other hand, this process has high corrosion rates and several disposal problems for its different wastes and effluents. The strong-acid process has no commercial importance - mainly due to the fact that this process requires high-purity propylene feed and has similar disposal problems like the weak-acid process.;Direct Hydration;According to Papa (2011), this production type exists since the beginning of the 1950s. Its overall reaction can be formulated as follows:;CH3CH = CH2 + H2O ⎯ catalyst → (CH3 )2CHOH;The main characteristics for this process are high pressure and low temperature over a acidic fixed-bed catalyst. Across the world, three different types of such a direct hydration process exist (for more details, see Papa (2011)). In Europe mainly the so-called 'phosphoric acid' process is used. Here, a phosphoric acid catalyst supported on SiO2 is operated at 180-260°C and a pressure of 2.5-6.5 MPa.;This dataset models the production of isopropanol by indirect (50%) and direct (50%) hydration of propylene with a process yield of 95%. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in an internal wastewater treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Reference:;Papa, A. J. 2011. Propanols.
