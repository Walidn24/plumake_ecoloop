Due to a lack of knowledge on the exact global share of both operations, the open-cast mining is assumed in this dataset. About 47 to 87 kg of celestite (3.8-3.9 g/cm3) are contained in one cubic meter of ore containing limestone, quartz, gypsum, and dolomite (all <3 g/cm3). During the mine operations, celestite is broken by drilling and blasting and the raw ore is mined. Assuming an average yield of 67 kg celestite/m3 ore, an average  density of 3.85 t/m3 ore, and a recovery efficiency of 75%, 76.62 kg of ore are mined per kg of celestite. Impurities are removed via desliming and celestite separated from other ores by means of density separation. Between 80% and 95% of strontium sulfate contained in the ore can be extracted.;References:; ;Nuss, P., & Eckelman, M. J. (2014). Life cycle assessment of metals: a scientific synthesis.
