(2023). The synthesis take place in a reactor that operates at 450 °C and 1.5 bar, while considering a SAPO-34 catalyst. ;The methanol feedstock, before being fed into the synthesis reactor, is pumped and heated to the reaction conditions. In the reactor, methanol is first dehydrated to dimethyl ether (DME), and DME, in turn, dehydrates further to yield ethylene, propylene, and smaller amounts of butenes. Hence, the conversion of methanol into olefins covers the following reaction steps:;1) Dehydration of methanol to DME: ;2 CH3OH <--> CH3OCH3 + H2O;2) Production of light olefins through DME dehydration:;CH3OCH3 --> C2H4 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --> 2/3 C3H6 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --> 2/4 C4H8 + H2O;Other reactions take place simultaneously, which give yield to methane, ethane, hydrogen, coke, and CO2.;The water generated from the dehydration stages should be removed prior the separation and purification stages. Notably, a significant amount of water at the reactor's outlet, amounting to 56.1% wt. of the total. Hence, the reactor outlet is first cooled to 25 °C and sent to a flash unit for the bulk water removal, and then compressed to 30.4 bar using a multistage compressor with intermediate cooling. At the same time, the remaining condensed water is removed.;The released heat from the latter exothermic reactor is used in a two-stage Rankine cycle to generate electricity. The two-stage Rankine cycle first partly consumes the reactor's heat by evaporating water at 55 bar from 45 to 430 °C. Subsequently, the pressure is released to 2 bar via a turbine, and then the stream's temperature increases to 430 °C by utilising the remaining heat of the reactor. The stream enters next to a second turbine where its pressure reduces to 0.1 bar. Finally, the steam temperature is reduced to 44 °C (1.5 °C lower than saturation temperature) and then pumped to 55 bar.;The stream enters a CO2 capture unit based on amine scrubbing and afterward, a dehydration unit that reduces the water content below 0.01 ppm to prevent the formation of hydrates in the cryogenic separations that follow. ;First, since the dry stream contains a small portion of H2, a series of three cryogenic knockout drums and a pressure swing adsorption unit are used for recovery. The three knockout drums operate at -60, -80, and -100 °C, respectively, and all liquid streams are mixed and sent to a demethaniser distillation column while the vapour stream is fed to the pressure swing adsorption unit. Finally, the purification of ethylene, propylene, butenes, and the remaining by-products is carried out via a;sequence of distillation columns with 99.9 % wt. purity.;Streams containing residual combustible gases (e.g., methane, ethane, etc), are combusted to generate electricity and heat, which covers partly the requirements of the light olefins production process.;References:;Dutta, Arnab, Iftekhar A.
