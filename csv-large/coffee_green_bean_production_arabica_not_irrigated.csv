Planting, cultivation and harvest are mechanized activities. This system is not irrigated. The period of 20 years was adopted as the average life span of a coffee plantation, from the cleaning of the land to the last year of the coffee plantation in production, before a new cleaning. In this study, it was assumed that the phases of implantation and formation of the coffee plantation last one year and two years, respectively. For the formation phase, the data collected correspond to the average of two years. The full production phase lasts 18 years. Grain production data were “annualized” (ie calculated for the reference of 1 hectare of coffee per year). Therefore, the input flows (natural resources, agricultural inputs and energy) and outflows (emissions to air, water and soil) of the initial phases were divided by 20. The input flows of the full production phase correspond to the average of two consecutive agricultural years, considering the behavior of the coffee plantation of alternating years of higher and lower production in succession. Mineral fertiliser input is 1534 kg ammonium sulphate, 255 kg monoammonium phosphate/ha, 1026 kg potassium chloride/ha, 15 kg N (inorganic nitrogen fertiliser)/ha and 20 kg P2O5 (inorganic phosphorus fertiliser)/ha. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 5.9 kg a.i./ha. The cattle manure input is 250 kg/ha. The average productivity is 2220 kg/ha, at 10% moisture.;The amount of packing for fertilisers was calculated by adding the NPK inputs (elements and not commercial fertiliser) multiplying this total by two.;Agricultural operation was modelled based on the total diesel consumed to perform the operation and the emissions to air related to diesel burning.",00.00.000,"No,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2020-01-01,2023-12-31,"Brazil, Minas Gerais",ecoinvent Data Quality System
