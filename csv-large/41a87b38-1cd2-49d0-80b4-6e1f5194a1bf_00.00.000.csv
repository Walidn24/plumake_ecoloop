This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge' is used for a large number of production processes in small workshops up to large factories and plants. It is used to operate simple compressed air pistols, manual machining tools as well as in automated machining centres.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'compressed air, 1200 kPa gauge',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
