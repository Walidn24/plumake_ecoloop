This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether'  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 034590-94-8. It is called '(2-methoxymethylethoxy)propanol' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CH3(OC3H6)2OH. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: coating products, anti-freeze products and lubricants and greases. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: coating products, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, lubricants and greases, inks and toners and polishes and waxes.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.
