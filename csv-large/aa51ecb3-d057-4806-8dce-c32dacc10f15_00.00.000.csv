This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'gypsum, mineral', in the geography of Europe.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 2.5%-6.2% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 13.17-47.35 in the same period).

It is mined together with anhydrite rock in open pit mining. The output of the mine is crushed and sorted. The intermediate products are composed of about 65% natural gypsum (CaSO4 * 2 H2O), 34% natural anhydrite rock (CaSO4) and 1% soil and gravel that are deposited back in the mine. The material is gained by blasting and digging. Gypsum is used by the cement industry; as a filler in the paper industry, and as raw material for (burned) anhydrite and stucco.
