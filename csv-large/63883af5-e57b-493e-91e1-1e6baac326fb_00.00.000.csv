This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'carbon dioxide, liquid', in the geography of Europe.;Special transport modelling for liquid gases: No ship transport and normal transport modelling for chemicals reduced by 90%.;;carbon dioxide, liquid'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 000124-38-9. It is called 'carbon dioxide' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CO2. It is liquid with no distinct odour. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: foods and beverages, fire extinguishers, refrigerants. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'carbon dioxide, liquid',  within the geography of Europe.

This activity ends with the supply of 'carbon dioxide, liquid',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
