The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 90.6 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 0%-11.2%-88.8%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0 kg O. The digestion process produces 92.75 litres of biogas with an energy content of 1.706MJ. 23.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 0%. The gross thermal efficiency is 0%.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
