Open pit mining requires drilling and blasting to reach load deposits. Ores are removed from the mine and transported to milling and beneficiating plants for concentrating the ore. After being crushed, the ores are ;dissolved in water and screened to separate the resulting insolubles from the solution. The crystals of sodium borate are dried from the solution and can either be sold as anhydrous borax or treated further to produce other borate materials.;References: ;US EPA.
