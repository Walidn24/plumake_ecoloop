The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations, according to the following equations:;2 X-Se   +   2 Na2CO3   +   3 CO2   ->   2 Na2O4Se   +   2 CO2   +   2 X	;(with X = compounds that were connected to Se - e.g. Cu2, CuAg, ....);2 Na2O4Se   +   4 HCl   ->   2 H2O3Se   +    4 NaCl   +   O2;2 H2O3Se   +   2 SO2   ->   2 Se   +   2 H2SO4   +   O2;A surplus input of 25% is assumed. The air emissions occurring from the process are estimated to 0.2% of the raw material input. ;The remaining amount of unreacted raw materials is assumed to leave the production process to 95% as a solid waste and to 5% in the wastewater. Further it is assumed that this wastewater is treated in an internal wastewater plant. The carbonate is dissolved in the water and not shown anymore in the dataset. Sodium and chloride are assumed to be neutralized within the waste water treatment plant, leading to emissions of Cl- and Na+ in the water outflow. Sodium dioxide will be reacted into sulphuric acid and therefore leads to emissions of SO42- in the water outflow.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
