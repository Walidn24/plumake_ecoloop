Barite is treated with coal from coke to deliver barium sulfide. There are two main routes to receive barium carbonate: precipitation with carbon dioxide and precipitation with soda (Kresse et al., 2007). The main producers (e.g. Solvay) are using the carbon dioxide method, this is modelled here. In this reaction the barium sulfide is treated with carbon dioxide, which was formed in the first reactions step, which produces barium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is assumed to be neutralised in waste water treatment and turned into Sulfate The reaction temperature is between 60 and 70 degree C. It is followed by filtering of the resulting slurry, washing, drying, grinding and packaging of barium carbonate. The assumed process efficiency is 90% per reaction step.;BaSO4 + 2 C --> BaS + 2 CO2;BaS + CO2 --> BaCO3 + H2S;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset.

The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The Gendorf factory is based in Germany, it produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products.;References:;Hischier, R.
