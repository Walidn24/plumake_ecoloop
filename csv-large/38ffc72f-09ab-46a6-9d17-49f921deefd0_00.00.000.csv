This dataset covers the treatment of undried  timber with inorganic CCB (chromium, copper, boron) salt with the oscillating pressure method. ;Wood is not included in the dataset. ;Pressure processes have been used for more than 150 years for impregnating wood with preservatives. The choice of the pressure process depends on the intended use, the nature and quality of the preservative, and the moisture level of the wood at the time of treatment.The oscillating pressure method was developed to impregnate green cordwood, particularly roundwood that is difficult to treat in the dry state. In this process, vacuum and pressure phases alternate, wheregy the phase changeover occurs in tess than a second. During the vacuum phases a small quantity of liquid is sucked out of the wood, and in the compression phases the salt solution is pressed in. As the impregnation period continues the pressure phases increase in lenght. For example, with green spruces, ca. 400 phase changes occur during the ca. 22-h impregnation process. Here the sap still present in the wood is continuously replaced by preservative liquid with an increase in the impregnation of the sapwood. For wood that is difficult to impregnate, the oscillating pressure method gives better impregnation and greated penetration depths than the vacuum-pressure method (also called full-cell or saturation impregnation method). Only water-borne preservaties are used.;The following figure illustrates the prinicple of the oscillating pressure method.

The data set contains the treatment service of undried wood with wood preservative based on inorganic CCB salts with the oscillating pressure method. It covers the necessary inputs of the wood preservative, electricity, ingredients for waste water/surface water treatment as well as some infrastructure. For the inventorying of emissions into surface water and air, see general comment. The dataset does not include wood. Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust recollected from the pressure vessel) are not included.
