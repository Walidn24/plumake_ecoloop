Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  'sulfidic tailings, from zinc-lead mine operation', in the geography of China.;This dataset represents the conveyance of 1 kg of sulfidic tailings generated in a zinc-lead mine, from the location in the mine where they are produced to the tailings impoundment.

This activity starts at the zinc-lead mine in the geography CN, where the tailings are generated.

This activity ends with the deposit of 1 kg of sulfidic tailings in the tailings impoundment. The energy and equipment required for pumping the tailings into the tailings impoundment are not included, as they should be taken into account in the mine operation activity.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling; Resource Extraction; Metals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
