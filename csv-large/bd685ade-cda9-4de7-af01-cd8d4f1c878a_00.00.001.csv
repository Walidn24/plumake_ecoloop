Technology involves large modern motorised forestry equipment. ;;Felling is by hand chainsaw, and cross-cutting takes place in the forest prior to extraction; extraction from the stump to the siding is by bulldozer or wheel-skidder.The typical overall average Azobe yield in littoral forest concessions in Cameroon is about 6 m3/ha (~1/2 tree/ha). Many small trees, often whole populations, are left standing to be harvested in another cycle, 35 â€“ 40 years afterwards; total rotation length can thus be assumed to be 70 to 80 years. The forest area is left to regenerate naturally as part of a policyclical forest management. ;;The high technological standard and legal operations of this dataset cannot be assumed to be representative for Azobe harvesting.;Azobe (Lophira alata; also know as Ekki or Bongossi) is a large to very large tree, up to over 50 m height and 150 cm diameter, fairly cylindrical almost down to the ground, without buttresses. It prefers sandy to sandy-loam moist soil, in a near fresh water swamps and riverbanks.;;The production practise equals natural growth in sustainable forestry. ;Natural growth relates to the forest area and CO2 from the atmosphere needed to produce azobe trees.
