This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'benzene', in the European geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'benzene' is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000071-43-2. It is called 'benzene' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C6H6. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a gasoline like odour. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: laboratory chemicals. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, coating, fillers, polymers, plastics and gasoline additives. If used as a fuel, it has a calorific value of 42.50 MJ/kg and is a fossil fuel, sourced from catalytic reforming of crude oil.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce benzene, within the geography of Europe.

This activity ends with the supply of benzene,  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
