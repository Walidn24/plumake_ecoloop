Bacteria are then added followed by oxygenation over a platinum catalyst. According to Oster and Fechtel (2011) the economics of the production of vitamin C is linked to the environmental costs. The following considerations are made by Oster and Fechtel (2011):;-	COD emissions are approximately equal to the amount of reference product;-	Being a derivate of sugars, the losses of these products are not problematic as easily biodegradable. The ketalized sugars on the other hand require hydrolyzation.;-	The loss of the catalyst is negligible. The losses are recovered by resins. For this reason, in this dataset no losses for catalysts are taken into account as they are considered to be 100% recovered.;-	Water scrubbers and activated carbon take care of exhaust gases.;-	The remaining solids are incinerated.;This inventory representing production of a particular chemical compound is at least partially based on a generic model on the production of chemicals. The data generated by this model have been improved by compound-specific data when available.;The model on production of chemicals is using specific industry or literature data wherever possible and more generic data on chemical production processes to fill compound-specific data gaps when necessary. The basic principles of the model have been published in literature (Hischier 2005, Establishing Life Cycle Inventories of Chemicals Based on Differing Data Availability). The model has been updated and extended with newly available data from the chemical industry.;In the model, unreacted fractions are treated in a waste treatment process, and emissions reported are after a waste treatment process that is included in the scope of this dataset. For volatile reactants, a small level of evaporation is assumed. Solvents and catalysts are mostly recycled in closed-loop systems within the scope of the dataset and reported flows are for losses from this system.;The main source of information for the values for heat, electricity, water (process and cooling), nitrogen, chemical factory is industry data from Gendorf. The values are a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de), (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The Gendorf factory is based in Germany, it produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products.;Reference(s):;Hischier, R.
