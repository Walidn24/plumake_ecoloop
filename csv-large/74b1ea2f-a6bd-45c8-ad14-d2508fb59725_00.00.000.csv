Three basic techniques exist for the electrolytic process: diaphragm, membrane and mercury cell technique. The mercury cell technique, however, has been phased out in recent years in Europe due to mercury's toxicity. The two remaining techniques differ in terms of electrode reaction and electrode materials, and in the way the chlorine produced is kept separate from sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. ;The chemical processes at the anode are the same for the two techniques: chloride ions are oxidised and gaseous chlorine (Cl2) is formed: ;Anode: 2 Cl- --> Cl2 + 2 e- ;In membrane and diaphragm cells, water is decomposed at the cathode into hydrogen and hydroxide ions: ;2 Na+ + 2 e- + 2 H2O --> 2 NaOH + H2;As a result, the overall reaction in the chlor-alkali unit for all techniques is: ;2 NaCl + 2 H2O --> Cl2 + 2 NaOH + H2;Treatment of sodium hydroxide is slightly different for the two cell types due to the difference in product output quality (composition and concentration of the sodium hydroxide produced). Hydrogen leaving the cells is highly concentrated (> 99.9 vol.-%) and usually only a little processing is needed. ;Sodium hypochlorite is produced by feeding gaseous chlorine into a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. ;The chlorine reacts with the sodium hydroxide under the formation of sodium hypochlorite, sodium chloride, and water: ;Cl2 + 2 NaOH --> NaOCl + NaCl + H2O ;When the desired concentration of sodium hypochlorite is reached, the solution is withdrawn from circulation and directed to a cooled storage tank. ;The technological coverage can be understood as representative for membrane technology, whereas the representativeness of diaphragm technology is rather low.;References: ;EuroChlor (2022): Chlorine (The Chlor-Alkali Process), An Eco-Profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry.;Brinkmann T., Santonja G.
