Cable manufacturing is a process that typically is composed of: Insulation of copper conductors or optical fibres with selected polymer(s);  If specified, shielding of insulated copper conductors (based on cable design); If specified, twisting of insulated conductors into pairs or triplets or quads (based on cable design); If specified, shielding of insulated pairs, triplets, or quads (based on cable design); Cabling of insulated conductors and/or pairs, triplets, quads into groups (based on cable de-sign); If specified, shielding of group(s) of conductors/pairs/triplets (based on cable design); Cabling of together unshielded and shielded groups of conductors into the cable bundle; If specified, overall shielding of cable bundle (based on cable design); If specified, application of separation barriers around cable bundle and/or overall shield; Jacketing over cable bundle or shielded cable bundle with selected polymer; Perform outgoing QA testing (tests based on cable design).",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Electronics",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
