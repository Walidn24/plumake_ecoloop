In the first reaction step aldehydes are formed with one more C-atom than the original olefins. For olefins with more than  two C-atoms, isomeric aldehyde mixtures are normally obtained. In the case of propylene these consist of 1-butanal and 2-methylpropanal.;There are several variations of the hydroformylation process, the differences being in the reaction conditions (pressure,  temperature) as well as the catalyst system used. The classic high-pressure process exclusively used until the beginning of  the 1970s operates at pressures of 20 – 30 MPa (200 – 300 bar) CO/H2 and temperatures of 100 – 180 °C. The catalyst is Co. It leads to about 75 % 1-butanol and about 25 % 2-methyl-1-propanol.;The new process developments of the past few years have led to a clear shift in the range of products. The processes operating  at relatively low pressures (1 – 5 MPa , 10 – 50 bar) use modified Rh-catalysts. The isomeric ratios achieved are about 92 : 8 or 95 : 5 1-butanol to 2-methyl-1-propanol. However, by the use of unmodified Rh the percentage of 2-methyl-1-propanol can be increased  to about 50 %. ;Catalytic hydrogenation of the aldehydes leads to the formation of the corresponding alcohols.;As only primary alcohols can be obtained via the oxo synthesis, it is not possible to produce 2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-propanol  by this process.;Reference:;Hahn, H., Dämkes, G., Ruppric, N.: Butanols.
