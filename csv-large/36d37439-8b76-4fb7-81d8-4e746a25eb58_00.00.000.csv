What might be changing is the 1) type of refrigerant, 2) energy consumption - efficiency and 3) leakage of the refrigerant. ;The datasets on transport, freight, lorry with refrigeration machine present in the ecoinvent database represent several scenarios with different type of refrigerant, energy consumption and leakage of the refrigerant.. ;The technology level is set reflecting the EURO classification, i.e. EURO3 is the oldest technology and EURO6 the newest. The R134a refrigerant is currently most widely used refrigerant, while the carbon dioxide, liquid is the newer more “environmentally friendly” solution. Therefore all the lorries using the carbon dioxide, liquid as refrigerant have higher level of technology than those using the R134a as refrigerant.
