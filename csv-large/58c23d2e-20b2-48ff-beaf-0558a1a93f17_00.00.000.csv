The functional unit represents the treatment of unsorted waste polyethylene, for recycling, yielding 1 kg of sorted waste polyethylene, for recycling.;Once the postconsumer PET has been collected, they must be separated from other co-collected materials and plastics. Although some recovered plastic is separated by curbside sorting and the use of separate bins at drop-off recycling centers, sorting and separation of plastics most commonly takes place at material recovery facilities (MRFs). Sorting operations at MRFs range from manual sorting of items on a conveyor to highly automated systems using magnets, air classifiers, optical sorters, and other technologies to sort and separate mixed incoming materials. Postconsumer plastics may be separated and baled as mixed plastics, or the facility may have the capability to further sort down to individual resin bales.
