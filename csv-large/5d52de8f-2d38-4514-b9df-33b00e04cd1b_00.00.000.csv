This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'pipeline, natural gas, long distance, high capacity, offshore', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a pipeline, high capacity that is used for natural gas distribution in long distances.  The infrastructure is made of steel and concrete, with a 1000mm diameter, and it remains in the sea at the end of the lifetime.  It has a capacity of 1.6 Mio. Nm3 gas per hour and a lifetime of 45 years. The process includes building materials, fuel burned in the machinery, land transformation, emissions and decommission.

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Fuels",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
