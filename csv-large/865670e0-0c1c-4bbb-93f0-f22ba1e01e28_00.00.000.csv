The functional unit represents the production of 1 kg of polyethylene terephthalate granulate, recycled, amorphous. This process delivers the byproduct waste polethylene, unsorted, for recycling.;About 40’000 t of PET bottles per year are collected in Switzerland and further processed to bottle grade (30 % recycling content) or amorphous (50 % recycling content) PET granulate. 20 % of the PET cannot be recycled again and is incinerated. Data for the PET recycling processes were derived via PET Recycling Schweiz (PRS).;After sorting, the pure-coloured PET bales are processed according to the United Resource Recovery Corporation (URRC)-procedure in one of two recycling plants in Switzerland. First, the wire around the PET bales is cut away and the bottles are separated again. The PET bottles pass through a metal separator which also separates aluminium-containing labels. The bottles are then shredded with knives to 12 mm size in the mill. The so-called flakes arrive from above into the air separator that separates the label residues from the PET flakes. The label residues end up in the incin-erator. Purified from the labels, the flakes land in a pool of water where the bottle caps, made of PE, float on top where-as the PET flakes which are heavier than water, sink to the bottom. Thus, the PE caps can be easily separated from the PET and are transferred to the PE recycling. The PET flakes are treated with 50% sodium hydroxide and the flakes-liquor mixture is heated to approximately 200 degree. The liquor dissolves the PET surface layer. With this procedure, even the SiOx coating of the bottle-inside is removed. The purified PET flakes are washed with water and then dried. The PET flakes have now such a high quality again that they may come into contact with bottle again. There are two recycled PET grades produced in Switzerland: amorphous and bottle grade. For bottle grade, the viscosity of the recycled flakes is increased to a comparable level of primary PET by solid state polymerization (SSP). Data were derived from involved recycling facilities.;For further information see Kägi et al. (2017).
