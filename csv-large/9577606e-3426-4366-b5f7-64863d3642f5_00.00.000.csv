This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'photovoltaic facade installation, 3kWp, multi-Si, panel, mounted, at building', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the installation of a photovoltaic facade installation, 3kWp, multi-Si, panel, mounted, at building. It has a capacity of 3kWp and a lifetime of 30 years. The process includes all the components for the installation of a  photovoltaic plant, energy use for the mounting and decommission. The assembly process is dependent on the type of façade. Here we assume a commonly used construction with aluminium profiles. About 75 kg of aluminium are used for the basic construction structure for 22m2 of panels. The integration of solar laminates in a façade is mainly useful for new buildings or as a part of renovation activities. It is more frequently used for industrial buildings.

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Electronics; Electricity",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
