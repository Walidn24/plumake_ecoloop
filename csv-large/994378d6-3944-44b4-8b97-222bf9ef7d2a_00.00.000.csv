This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the market for tubular particleboard in Europe.;Particleboard – also known as particle board, and chipboard – is an engineered wood product manufactured from wood chips, sawmill shavings, or even sawdust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. ;Like a bridge construction, tubular particleboard provides an ideal combination of light weight and stability. Compared to solid boards, the weight of tubular particleboard is reduced by up to 60%. Tubular particleboards are used for door cores, isolation boards, furniture, packing, and decoration.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S. Diederichs (2012): Ökobilanz-Basisdaten für Bauprodukte aus Holz.
