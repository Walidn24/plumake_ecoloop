This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat and power co-generation unit, 200kW electrical, components for electricity only', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, components for electricity only, with an electrical output of 200 kW. The process includes all components related exclusively to electricity production (electric parts, generator 200 kW electrical, and assembly of generator and motor). The factor of the electrical performance class is derived from the assumed total operating time of 100,000 hours divided by the service life of the components.

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat; Electricity",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
