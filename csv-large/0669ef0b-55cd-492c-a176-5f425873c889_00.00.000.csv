As MDI exists in three isomers, a distribution of MDI isomers is obtained, where their share depends on the ratio of aniline to formaldehyde, the acid concentration, and the reaction conditions.;Methylene dianiline (MDA) synthesis: 2C6H7N + CH2O -> C13H14N2+H2O;The mixture at the reactor outlet is neutralised with caustic soda, and separated into an organic phase and an inorganic (aqueous) phase. The latter phase contains the crude MDA isomer mixture, and is washed. Excess amounts of aniline are recovered with distillation and recycled to the MDA synthesis stage. At the same time, the inorganic (aqueous) phase is further purified from any residual organic substance, and subsequently discharged for additional treatment and recovery stages.;The crude MDA isomer mixture is subsequently treated with phosgene to produce an MDI isomer mixture in solution, along with HCl byproduct.;MDA phosgenation: C13H14N2  + 2COCl2  -> C15H10N2O2  + 4HCl;In absence of phosgene in the form of a raw material, this intermediate is produced on-side from carbon monoxide and chlorine.;Phosgene production: CO + Cl2 -->  COCl2;The crude MDI solution is first separated by the solvent, which is recovered via distillation, and subsequently purified through fractional distillation, crystallisation, or sublimation.;Reference(s):;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) , 3 - SeparatePublication",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2026-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
