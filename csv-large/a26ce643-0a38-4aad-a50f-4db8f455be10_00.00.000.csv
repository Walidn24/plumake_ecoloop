Based on stoichiometry, 0.53286 kg of magnesium are required as an input per kg of Zr Sponge and 2.0874 kg of magnesium chloride is produced as a byproduct per kg of produced Zr sponge. Because 0.0484 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, 2.0386 kg of MgCl2 per kg Zr sponge are sent to electrolysis.;;The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2. After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, during which zirconium sponge is produced, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the carbochlorination process as an input.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals; Chemicals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,France,ecoinvent Data Quality System
