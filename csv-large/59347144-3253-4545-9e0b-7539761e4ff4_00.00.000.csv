This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. ;This is the market for  'hydrogen, gaseous, low pressure' in the Global geography for direct consumption.;This product is generally considered an intermediate product and as such expected to be used at or in the vicinity of the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;For processes demanding gaseous hydrogen, it is advised to set direct activity links to the producing activit(ies).;'hydrogen, gaseous, low pressure' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001333-74-0. It is called 'molecular hydrogen' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H2. It is gas under normal applied low pressure and it has no odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the solvent of their choice in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: Fuels and related products, water treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Fuels and fuel additives, functional fluids (closed systems), intermediates, laboratory chemicals, odor agents, oxidizing/reducing agents, processing aids, specific to petroleum production.

The activity begins with the product leaving the production site.

The activity ends with the product arriving at the user. As this product is generally considered to be used on or in close vicinity to the production site, no transport requirements are included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
