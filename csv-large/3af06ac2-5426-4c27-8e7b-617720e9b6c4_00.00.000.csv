This is in the North-Eastern region of the province KwaZulu-Natal.;The mineral sands are harvested via a system of ponds and floating dredges and the concentration is done on a floating gravity separation plant. These two stages of the process take place in the same location. The concentrator produces two streams: a magnetic and non-magnetic stream. The magnetic stream consists of ilmenite while the non-magnetic stream consists of zircon and rutile. ;This concentrate is transported to the second location where the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) and the smelter are situated. At the MSP the various minerals are separated to produce zircon, rutile and ilmenite.;The ilmenite is smelted to produce titania slag (85% TiO2). High quality (low manganese content) pig iron is produced as a by-product in this stage. The ilmenite first undergoes an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation where the Cr2O3 fraction of the ilmenite is removed. The ilmenite is then partially reduced to 85% TiO2 slag in a six-in-line A.C. electric arc furnace",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Minerals; Metals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,South Africa,ecoinvent Data Quality System
