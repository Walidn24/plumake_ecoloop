For cost reasons in most of the cases no buffer storage is installed. Due to this fact, it is very important to adjust the three cycles (heat use cycle, heat pump cycle, heat source cycle) in the best possible way to ensure optimal heat transfer at all times. ;References:;Persönliche Mitteilung Herr Keel, Zürcher Energieberatung, Zürich, August 1993.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat",1990-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
