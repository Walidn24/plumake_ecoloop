In the batch mode, the toluene is fed at around 25°C into the reactor, where the nitric acid is added slowly while the mixture temperature is maintained to 25°C, through cooling, until the entire amount of acid is introduced. Subsequently, the temperature is raised slowly to 35-40°C, at which the nitration takes place while the rate of the oxidative side reactions is minimized. The reaction has a yield of around 96%, obtaining a mixture of mononitrotoluenes. The product mixture is separated, and the spend acid is reconcentrated, while the crude product is washed with dilute caustic and water. The resulting product comprise of mononitrotoluenes mixture of 55-60% wt. o-nitrotoluene, 3-4% wt. m-nitrotoluene, and 35-40% p-nitrotoluene and the separation of the isomers is achieved via combining fractional distillation and crystallization (Kirk, 2004).;Reaction:;C7H8 + HNO3 → C6H4(CH3)NO2 + H2O;C7H8 + 2HNO3 → C6H3CH3(NO2)2 + 2H2O, (undesirable reaction, reduced rate due to control conditions);In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, where 1 kg of nitrotoluene isomers 0.584, 0.380, and 0.036 kg of o-, p-, and m-nitrotoluene, respectively, in a purified form;References:;Kirk, Raymond E., Donald F.
