One- and two-stage versions of the process are on stream. In the one-stage method, an ethylene-oxygen mixture reacts with the catalyst solution. In the two-stage process the reaction is carried out with ethylene and then with oxygen in two separate reactors. The catalyst solution is alternately reduced and oxidized. At the same time the degree of oxidation of the catalyst changes alternately. Air is used instead of pure oxygen for the catalyst oxidation.;Reaction:;C2H4 +  0.5O2 --> C2H4O;This dataset covers the direct oxidation (Wacker process) of the acetaldehyde production. Namely, ethylene and oxygen, along with a recycle stream, are fed to a reactor filled with the catalyst solution, under slight pressure. The reactor effluent is scrubbed with water, and the top gaseous mixture is the recycled into the reactor. Finally, the scrubbed mixture is fed into a distillation column.;The direct oxidation of ethylene is catalysed with an aqueous solution of PdCl2 and CuCl2. Notably, only a small amount of PdCl2 is used in this process since the metallic palladium is reoxidized by CuCl2 that, in turn, is regenerated with oxygen.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, while the catalytic system is not covered.;References:;Eckert, M., Fleischmann, G., Jira, R., Bolt, H.
