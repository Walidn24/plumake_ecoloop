Synthetic rubber is delivered in bulk to the plant. In a first stage different raw materials are kneaded. The rubber mass is rolled out in size of the latter rubber basic furs which are brought to an intermediate storage. For a part of these furs the finishing process takes place in Zeulenroda. The bulk is further processed in MÃ¼nster. These rubber basic furs are warmed up again in the next rolling mill and some necessary raw materials are added. The mass is extruded to the form of the final product. Than the tubes are brought to the batch-ovens or to the conti-ovens for vulcanisation. During this process they simultaneously blow out to their final size. The product is cut to size, labelled and packed in cardboard. Most (82%) of the production wastes are recycled within the same production process.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1997-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
