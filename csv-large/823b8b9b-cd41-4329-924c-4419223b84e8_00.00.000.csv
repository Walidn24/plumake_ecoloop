(2021) that was, in turn, based on the environmental impact assessment report for a joint venture between China Power Investment Corporation and Total, Ltd., in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China.;In the methanol-to-olefins process, the methanol feedstock is first dehydrated to dimethyl ether (DME), and DME, in turn, dehydrates further to yield ethylene, propylene, and smaller amounts of butenes. Hence, the conversion of methanol into olefins covers the following reaction steps:;1) Dehydration of methanol to DME: ;2 CH3OH <--> CH3OCH3 + H2O;2) Production of light olefins through DME dehydration:;CH3OCH3 --> C2H4 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --> 2/3 C3H6 + H2O;CH3OCH3 --> 2/4 C4H8 + H2O;Other reactions take place simultaneously, which give yield to methane, ethane, C5 hydrocarbons, hydrogen, coke, and CO2. At the same time, additional steps to upgrade the C4-C5 fractions could enhance the yield towards propylene.;This inventory covers the production of propylene, ethylene, LPG, C5s, and gasoline, along with the consumption of energy and auxiliary materials and services. The data is based on an existing project for the coal-to-olefins production process. Namely, the plant, which this inventory represents, is located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China and was built in 2016. This plant has an annual olefin output of 800 000 t,;References:;2021, Lin Lv, Guobao Song, Xinyue Zhao, Jingwen Chen, Environmental Burdens of Chinaâ€™s Propylene manufacturing: Comparative life-cycle assessment and scenario analysis, Science of the Total Environment, 799;Bertau, M., Offermanns, H., Plass, L., Schmidt, F., & Wernicke, H.
