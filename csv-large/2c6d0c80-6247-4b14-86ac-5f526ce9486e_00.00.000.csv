This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'nuclear waste storage, final repository for low level radioactive waste', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a nuclear waste storage, final repository for low level radioactive waste. The infrastructure is suitable for approximately 100,000 m3 of waste like conditioned spent fuel (SF), vitrified high level waste (HLW) and intermediate level waste (ILW) repository. In a first approximation, the same values for land conversion and buildings are accounted as for the ""nuclear waste storage, final repository for high level radioactive waste"". The time for construction and sealing of the repository is set as 8 years and 20 years are assumed as the operating time. With a period of 28 years for all land use, the value for the industrial area is 7.28E+5 m2a, for the grassland 1.82E+5 m2a. The process includes building material and energy requirements for concstruction, land use and decommission.  

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Waste Treatment & Recycling",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
