This is a renaming activity. Its purpose is to link 'basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag' to the 'market for basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag, for recovery'. This represents the share of basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag that is recovered for use via internal (in iron and steelmaking) or external routes (e.g. cement making).Through this renaming, the by-product classification of the basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag is changed from 'waste' to 'recyclable material'.

Activity starts with the reception of 'basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag'.

Activity ends with the 'basic oxygen furnace secondary metallurgy slag, for recovery' being ready for transportation.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling; Metals,2020-01-01,2025-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
