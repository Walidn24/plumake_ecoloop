The cyclohexyl hydroperoxide formed is trapped as the cyclohexyl perborate ester. The perborate ester then reacts with additional cyclohexane in the air oxidizer to yield the borate ester and additional cyclohexanol. This borate ester is relatively stable in the air oxidizer and is protected from over oxidation to ring-opened products. The ester is subsequently hydrolyzed to cyclohexanol and boric acid. The boric acid is dehydrated to metaboric acid and is recycled to the air oxidizer.;a) Air oxidizers; b) Ester hydrolysis vessel; c) Decanter; d) Extraction column; e) Cyclohexane recovery column; f) Refining column; g) Stripping column; h) Vaccuum crystallizer; i) Boric acid centrifuge; j) Boric acid slurry tank; k) Dehydrator ;Both cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone are produced on a large commercial scale. The vast majority of these compounds and their mixtures is consumed in the production of caprolactam and adipic acid, intermediates in the manufacture of nylon 6 and nylon 66. 95 % of the cyclohexanone worldwide is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane (Wells 1991).;References:;Musser, M.
