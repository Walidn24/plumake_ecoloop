Therefore the European feedstock mix was applied in the upstream steam cracking activity. The used feedstock is as follows(share by mass): butane (16.2%), ethane (4.5%), naphtha (64%), natural gas liquids (2.2%), propane (7.6%), refinery gas (1.5%) and atmospheric gas oil (4%, proxied by diesel).;Butadiene cannot be separated from the C4 hydrocarbon mixture leaving the steam cracker by simple distillation, since butadiene and butane form an azeotrope. The most applied methods are liquid-liquid extraction and extractive distillation.;The method of choice for this dataset is isolation of butadiene by extractive distillation with N-methylpyrrolidone as a solvent (BASF-NMP). ;The process consists of four subprocesses, C3 predistillation, extractive distillation, degassing and butadiene distillation,;In the C3 predistillation, the more unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g. acetylenes and diolefins, are dissolved in NMP, whilst the butenes/butanes are removed from the top of the washer. ;In the extractive distillation step, the C4 acetylenes and part of the 1,2-butadiene are removed from the bottom of the tower. This is possible since these substances are more soluble in NMP than 1,3-butadiene. ;The 1,3-butadiene is removed from the top of the tower and is separated from the additional compounds (propyne and C5 hydrocarbons) by degasing;In a final step, the 1,3-butadiene is distilled.;References:;Grub, J.; LÃ¶ser, E.
