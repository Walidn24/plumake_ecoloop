This dataset corresponds to semi-automatized factories, which incorporates some machinery in their processes. However, one of the factories only uses diesel in the machinery, while the second factory uses diesel and electricity. The manufacturing process includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming by extrusion, drying, firing of wood, cooling and storage of bricks until they are sold directly to the clients or to intermediaries. The mix of raw material is deposited in a mill, then moved to an extruder formed by a mixer and a matrix.",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete; Minerals,2022-01-01,2023-12-31,Ecuador,ecoinvent Data Quality System
