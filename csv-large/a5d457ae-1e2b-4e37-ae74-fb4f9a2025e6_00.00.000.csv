The activity starts with the establishment of the greenhouse with HDPE film and considers soil improvement, fertilization, transport of inputs and transport packaging materials.The dataset also contains the disposal of the transport packaging (after plantation of the seedling).

The activity ends with the seedlings packed for transportation. The dataset does not contain data on water use, frame infrastructure of the greenhouse and on the use of fungicides, insecticides etc. as source does not provide this information.",00.00.000,"Swiss brush-up completed,Sector: Forestry",2002-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
