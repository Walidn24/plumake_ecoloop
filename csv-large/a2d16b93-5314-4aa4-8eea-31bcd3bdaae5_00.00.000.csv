Most plants in the country use Pelton turbines.  The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel, the turbine, the generator and the transformer and are listed below:;Efficiency of power plant               current    modern;Works water channel	        0.95	     0.95;Turbine	                                        0.87	     0.91;Generator	                                        0.96      0.98;Transformer	                        0.98	     0.99;Reservoir power plant total		;without works water channel           0.82	     0.88;with works water channel                0.78	     0.84;Pumped storage power plant        0.70	    0.74;References:;Bischof, R.
