In a first step, the natural gas feedstock is desulfurized and pre-treated with some steam to break down higher hydrocarbons into methane. The steam to carbon ratio at the pre-reformer inlet is set to 2.6. The pre-treated feedstock is then led into the main reforming reactor, and methane is coverted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This reaction is endothermic (consumes energy), and therefore heat is provided by an external furnace (often fuelled with natural gas). The hydrogen yield is improved by a water gas shift section, where a part of the formed carbon monoxide reacts with water to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In this process, full water gas shift is assumed and therefore no synthesis gas (mixture of CO and H2) is co-produced, Technical details of the SMR plant which serves as model for this dataset are presented in Antonini, Treyer et al. (2020). Hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane with carbon capture and storage - A techno-environmmental analysis. Sustainable Energy & Fuels.;SMR: CH4 + H2O --> 3 H2 + CO;WGS: CO + H2O --> H2 + CO2;Carbon dioxide is not captured in this modelling, it exits the plant with the flue gas from the furnace.;The high pressure steam required in steam methane reforming as well as the water gas shift is co-generated by heat integration. The excess steam is sent to a turbine to genereate electricity, which can be used to run utilities in the plant. If there is a surplus of electricity, it is sold to be fed to the grid.;The catalysts used in the desulfurization is ZnO, reforming needs a Nickel based catalyst and the water gas shift is conducted on Fe-Cr and Cu-Zn beds.;The purity of the produced hydrogen is at least 99.97%;.The electricity and heat needed in all processes is produced internally from natural gas. In the technical modelling of Antonini/Treyer et al. an amount of excess electricity results from this internal electricity production, it is assumed to be sold to the grid.;References:;Antonini C., Treyer K., Streb A., van der Spek M., Bauer C., Mazzotti M.
