This global dataset is a copy of the regional NZ dataset, except for the following modifications.;The production volume represents the global annual production.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.;Yield of the global dataset = 11300000 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the NZ regional dataset.;The dataset refers to the production of 1 Onion Seedling raised in a nursery during one year. From a onion nursery of 1 ha, seedlings for 10 ha productive onion fields can be obtained, i.e. a total of 11'300'000 seedlings are obtained from 1 ha nursery. This number (10 ha) is calculated from the weight of 1 onion seedling (5 g), the yield (55 t/ha) and the number of seedlings per ha (1'130'000). ;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) =1.5 (i.e. excellent quality).;This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters

The activity starts with soil cultivation of the field in order to establish a onion nursery for 1 year.

The inventory includes the process total diesel combusted in agricultural machinery. Machine infrastructure including a shed for shelter and fuel use are also considered. Inputs of fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation are included. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered. 
The activity ends with harvesting onion seedlings.",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
