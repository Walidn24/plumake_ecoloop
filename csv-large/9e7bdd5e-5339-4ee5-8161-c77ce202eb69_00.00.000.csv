Inputs to the arc furnace are oxide of iron and chromium (chromite, with Cr/Fe = 3.8 in Kazakhstan), coke or coal (used as reducing agent), dolomite, silica and/or bauxite (used as fluxing agents for slag formation). The smelting charge can be pre-heated and pre-reduced in a rotary kiln.Water is used during the operations. Main emissions from the smelting process are dust and fume. Dust occur from storage, handling and pre-treatment of raw materials. Depending on the raw material and on the process, other emissions to air are SO2, NOx, CO-gas, CO2, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), VOCs, and volatile metals. The formation of dioxins is possible. Process residues and by-products are mainly slag and filter dust (or dry cake, considered as inert material).;;Reference:;USGS 2016.
