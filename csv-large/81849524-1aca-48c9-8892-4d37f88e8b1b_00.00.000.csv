This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'potato', in the Global geography.;In this market, default transport model and expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The default transport distances are built on a generic model which assigns the transport distances based on the ISIC code. This approach is, especially in case of fruits and vegetables, rather coarse. So in a certain cases expert judgement is used to adjust the default distances.;;The transport distances and associated impacts presented in the markets represents the average scenario for given geography. In case of fruits and vegetables the final impact at the consumer vary a lot depending on whether the food is consumed near the producer or far. The average impact of, for example, banana is overestimated if the consumer is present in Brazil and it is heavily underestimated is the consumer is present in Europe. The markets are modelled so, that editing to model concrete scenario is possible and easy.;;Fruits and vegetables are traded all over the world on an increasing scale.;It is assumed, that all potatoes which are transported are being transported by infrastructure equipped for transport of goods in need of atmosphere control.;;The recomended conditions for transport of potatoes are (Hamburg Sud, 2013, Stay cool, We care, category: potato (table)); temperature: +5 to +10Â°C, ventilation: 10 to 50 m3/h, humidity (relative): 85 to 95 %, approximate shelf life (in ambient air): 2 to 12 months.;The product 'potato' is a root vegetable. It is an annual crop. The ecoinvent database also contains this product from organic and Swiss integrated production.
