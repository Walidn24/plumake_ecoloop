Occasionally pellets are used;in the steel process.;Pellets are stored in bunkers before charging to the blast furnace.;The mixture of iron bearing materials (iron ore rubble, sinter and/or pellets) and additives (flux material);are known collectively as the ""burden"". The burden and the accompanying coke are charged into the top;of the furnace either via skips or mechanical conveyor belts. It enters into the furnace via a sealed;charging system, which isolates the furnace gases from the atmosphere.;As for all blast furnace material (coke, sinter, pellets and lump ore) a final screening takes place at the;blast furnace site. Undersize pellets can be recycled.;The pellets for the BOS plant are stored in bunkers. Transport in the BOS plant can take place by truck or;conveyor belt.                            Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 6–16 mm (0.24–0.63 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces. They typically contain 67%-72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets.Typically limestone, dolostone and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder.;;The process of pelletizing combines mixing of the raw material, forming the pellet and a thermal treatment baking the soft raw pellet to hard spheres. The raw material is rolled into a ball, then fired in a kiln to sinter the particles into a hard sphere.;;The configuration of iron ore pellets as packed spheres in the blast furnace allows air to flow between the pellets, decreasing the resistance to the air that flows up through the layers of material during the smelting. The configuration of iron ore powder in a blast furnace is more tightly-packed and restricts the air flow. This is the reason that iron ore is preferred in the form of pellets rather than in the form of finer particles.
