This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'aluminium sulfate, powder', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'aluminium sulfate, powder'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 010043-01-3. It is called 'dialuminum trisulfate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: Al2O12S3. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and may have a crystalline/pellets/powder form. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: pH regulators and water treatment products, water treatment chemicals, fertilisers, cosmetics and personal care products and washing & cleaning products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: laboratory chemicals, pH regulators and water treatment products, paper chemicals and dyes, leather treatment products, textile treatment products and dyes and coating products.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'aluminium sulfate, powder',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'aluminium sulfate, powder',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
