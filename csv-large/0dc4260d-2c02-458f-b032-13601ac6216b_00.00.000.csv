In this case, process most likely is optimised in a way that the maximum yield of biogas is achieved. The reason for this is that a higher biogas throughput in the biogas upgrading plant significantly reduces the cost for the biogas upgrading. Thus, the required energy demand is obtained externally from conventional energy carriers.;Sewage gas is produced in digestion tanks and is temporarily stored in gasholders (pressure about 20 mbar). The fermentation process requires electricity for sludge mixing and heat for maintaining a uniform temperature in order to optimise bacterial activity. For sludge digestion usually a temperature between 30 and 40 °C is chosen; i.e. mesophile fermentation. In line with literature, we assume a degradation rate of 45% of organic dry matter and a total share of dry matter in the raw sludge of 4-6%. The products of the fermentation process are sewage gas (also referred to as biogas from sewage sludge digestion) and sewage sludge. For the use of the gas as a fuel for cogeneration no further treatment is required.;References:;Vogt 2002. Vogt R., Knappe F., Giegrich J. and Detzel A. (2002) Ökobilanz Bioabfallverwertung.
