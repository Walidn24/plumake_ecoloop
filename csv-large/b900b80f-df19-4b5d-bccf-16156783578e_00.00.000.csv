This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on IEA statistics (http://www.iea.org/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=25) for the year 2009. They amount to about 63% heat from coal and peat, 14% heat from oil, 22% heat from biofuels (modelled with wood) and 1% heat from geothermal sources. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. ;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through various other means than natural gas. This includes burning of biomethane in gas turbine; biogas in co-gen gas engine; anthracite, coal, lignite briquettes and coke in stove; hardwood, logs, softwood, wood chips, wood pellets in furnaces and wood heaters; light fuel oil in boilers. Also contributing are heat from heat pumps and solar collectors. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas',  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.

This activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe without Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
