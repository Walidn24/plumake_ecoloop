This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'ethylene oxide', in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site. Therefore, the market does not contain any transport or losses.;ethylene oxide'  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000075-21-8. It is called 'oxirane' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C2H4O. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a faintly sweet odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: inks and toners and fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce ethylene oxide within the geography of this dataset, with the product ready to be used.

This activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of ethylene oxide to the consumers of this product. Transport is not included as this product is generally considered to be used at the production site. No product losses are included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
