This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'alkylketene dimer sizing agent, for paper production', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product “alkylketene dimer sizing agent, for paper production”, also called AKD sizer, is a sizing agent used in the paper industry. Sizing agents are used for improving the paper resistance to aqueous liquids. Most often used types of sizing agents are natural products in form of modified natural resins (resin size), starch, or modified starch, as well as synthetic products. One of the most widely used synthetic sizing agent is alkyl ketene dimer (AKD). The main advantage of AKD is that only 0.1% (relative to dry stock) of active substance are needed (European Commission (2000)). ;AKD sizer is synthesized from fatty acids. According to Hubbe (2002) it is most commonly in form of a dispersion – with waxy solid material dispersed as small particles in a solution that contains a stabilizer, i.e. cationic starch. 

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'alkylketene dimer sizing agent, for paper production',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'alkylketene dimer sizing agent, for paper production',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals; Pulp & Paper",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
