This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'lightweight concrete block, expanded vermiculite', in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations;Lightweight concrete blocks are made from aggregates with porous structure, which is mixed with cement and water. In this case, the aggregate is expanded vermiculite. The raw material mixture (aggregates, cement and water) of lightweight concrete blocks are poured into a mould then squeezed and finaly hardened by air. The main use of lightweight and autoclaved aerated concrete blocks are precision blocks, precision building plates, roof and floor panels, reinforced wall partition blocks, assembly beam, head and pillar units.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'lightweight concrete block, expanded vermiculite',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'lightweight concrete block, expanded vermiculite',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Cement & Concrete",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
