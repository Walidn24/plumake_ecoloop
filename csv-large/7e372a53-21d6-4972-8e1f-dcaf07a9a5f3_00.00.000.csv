The most common means for reduction of hard water relies on ion exchange resins or reverse osmosis; in limited circumstances, it is performed  through the use of chemicals additives specially, lime softening (WaterProfessionals, 2017).;;Ion exchange water softening process, apart from being the most conventional method, it is also the oldest method used to remove calcium and magnesium ions from water. It  comprises a cation exchange resin on which the mobile ion inside the bed is typically sodium. When hard water passes through the resin, hardness ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+) move into the resin bed and each cation is replaced by two sodium ions getting out of the resin. Water salinity does not change, only the constituents of salinity. ;;Once capacity is exhausted, a water softener must be regenerated using salt. The regeneration process consists on backwash, brine draw/slow rinse, fast rinse and refill.",00.00.000,Sector: Water Supply,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
