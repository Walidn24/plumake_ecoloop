Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping. It is then sprayed into the air through sprinklers so that it breaks up into small water drops which fall to the ground. The pump supply system, sprinklers and operating conditions must be designed to enable a uniform application of water.;This method is suited for most row, field and tree crops and water can be sprayed over or under the crop. Sprinklers are best suited to sandy soils with high infiltration rates although they are adaptable to most soils, nevertheless, are not suitable for soils which easily form a crust.;A good clean supply of water, free of suspended sediments, is require to avoid problems of sprinkler nozzle blockage and spoiling the crop by coating it with sediment (FAO, 1985b)",00.00.000,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Brazil,ecoinvent Data Quality System
