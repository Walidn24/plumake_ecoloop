The method preferred for the commercial preparation of diborane is the addition of boron trifluoride to a stirred solution of sodium tetrahydridoborate in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme): ;Diborane is shipped either as a compressed gas (ambient) or as a liquid (cylinder over packaged with dry ice). It is packaged as a hazardous material regulated by the DOT. ;References:;Brotherton, R..: Boron Compounds. Published online: 2000.
