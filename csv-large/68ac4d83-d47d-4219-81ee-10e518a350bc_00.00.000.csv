These harden the surface of the glass, giving the inside more time to cool. This allows the external layer to crystallize into a wider lattice while the inside solidifies with greater compression than in the crystal lattice.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Minerals",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
