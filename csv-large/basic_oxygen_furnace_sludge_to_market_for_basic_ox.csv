This is a renaming activity. Its purpose is to link 'basic oxygen furnace sludge' to the 'market for basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery'. This represents the share of basic oxygen furnace sludge that is recovered for use via internal (in iron and steelmaking) or external routes (e.g. cement making).Through this renaming, the by-product classification of the basic oxygen furnace sludge is changed from 'waste' to 'recyclable material'.

Activity starts with the reception of 'basic oxygen furnace sludge'.

Activity ends with the 'basic oxygen furnace sludge, for recovery' being ready for transportation.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling; Metals,2020-01-01,2025-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
