This is achieved by oxygen enrichment of the hot blast. The recovery of manganese in the alloy is usually 75 – 85 %. This is influenced by the MnO content of the slag, the slag-to-metal ratio, and losses in the flue gases. The MnO content of the slag is highly dependent on the basicity ratio (CaO + MgO)/SiO2.;The reduction of the higher manganese oxides to manganese(II) oxide takes place in the upper zone of the shaft (reduction of manganese oxides with carbon monoxide and carbon). These generally occur below 900 °C and are indirect. The reactions are exothermic, and the heat generated causes high top temperatures and necessitates water cooling of the furnace top. The reduction of manganese(II) oxide MnO + C  Mn + CO is highly endothermic, in contrast to the weakly endothermic reduction of wustite. This requires higher temperatures and, consequently, higher coke rates are required for the smelting of ferromanganese in blast furnaces.;ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE:;The majority of producers of ferromanganese in the Western world use submerged arc electric furnaces. Although electric furnaces have lower capacities than blast furnaces they have the advantage that the heat requirement is provided by electricity, and coke and coal are added to the feed only as reductants. Recently built electric furnaces have capacities of 75 – 90 MVA. Smaller furnaces are still popular with producers because they offer flexibility in that they can be switched more easily between different products than their larger counterparts. Electric furnaces used are generally circular and have three electrodes. The reduction of manganese(II) oxide occurs by the contact of carbon with the molten oxide in the slag phase. The overall reaction is :;MnO + 10/7 C   1/7 Mn7C3 + CO;Large electric furnaces are usually completely closed at the top, and the CO-rich gas leaves the furnace at approximately 290 °C and is cleaned in cyclones and venturi scrubbers. The gas is then either flamed off to the atmosphere or, more recently, is used to generate electricity. Smaller furnaces may be open, the gas then is usually withdrawn by fans and cleaned in a bag-filter plant. In this case the gases are completely burnt in the furnace and have no commercial value.;After the metal is tapped from the furnace it is cast into moulds formed from ferromanganese fines or cast iron and allowed to solidify. The alloy is then removed, crushed, and screened into various size fractions, depending on the requirements of the user. An alternative to this practice is the use of a casting machine. In this case the metal is tapped directly onto a moving train consisting of small molds. The metal then solidifies and is ejected from the mould at the end of the strand.;Adelhardt & Saiger (1999) distinguishes between a electric arc furnace process with calcareous flux and one without flux, where the energy consumption is smaller due to reduction of the ore by excess CO. The yield of the process without flux is smaller with 70% compared with 75% of the process with calcareous flux, due to a slag richer in MnO. However, the manganese rich slag – sometimes over 25% manganese – of the process without flux is used in the production of silicomanganese, enhancing the overall yield considerably.;Overall emissions: The main environmental impact by producing ferro-alloys is the emission of dust and fume from the smelting processes. Dust emissions occur as well from storage, handling and the pre-treatment of raw materials where fugitive dust emissions play an important role. Depending on the raw material and the process used other emissions to air are SO2, NOx, CO-gas, CO2, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), VOCs, and volatile metals. The formation of dioxins in the combustion zone and in the cooling part of the off-gas treatment system (de-novo synthesis) may be possible.;Water emissions are produced from cooling, granulation and other processes and site related effluents. The wastewater generated by a wet cleaning abatement system plays also an important role.;Overall waste: Process residues and by-products with a significant amount is slag, filter dust and sludge and spent refractories. These materials are already recycled and reused to a large extent where it is possible. Rich slag, that means slag with a relatively high proportion of metal oxides, is used as raw material in other ferro-alloy productions.;References:;Wellbeloved D. B., Craven P. M. and Waudby J. W.
