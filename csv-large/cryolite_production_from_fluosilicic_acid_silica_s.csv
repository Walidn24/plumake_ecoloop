In both cases, the reactants can be combined with a variety of materials, such as Al2O3 · 3 H2O, Al2O3 · x NaOH,  NaOH, NaCl, and Na2SO4. During the present reaction, fluosilicic acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide.  Then it reacts with Al2O3 to produce cryolite and silica.;The reaction process is shown below:;Al2O3 + 2H2SiF6 + 6 NaOH --> 2 Na3AlF6 + 2 SiO2 + 5 H2O ;It is difficult to predict how much of the cryolite is produced with the present reaction, since many production routes exist. The present inventory serves as an illustration of the cryolite production from fluosilicic acid. The alternative production route with HF is still considered to be the main production route (source: Ullmann encyclopedia, Cryolite, 2005).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1960-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
