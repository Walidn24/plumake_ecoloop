Despite their low concentra-tion and reserves, increased production of REEs from these deposits has been reported over the last 10 years, due to easiness of mining and concentrating through through the use of weak acids. For this reason, in-situ leaching has become the prominent method for REE extraction from ion adsorption clays. Ammonium sulfate is used in order to leach the ion adsorption clays, with the precipitation of the leachate occurring through the use of ammonium bicarbonate or oxalic acid. The resulting carbonate concentrate contains approximately 45% REOs.",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
