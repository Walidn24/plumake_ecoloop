""""After drying and calcination, 90âˆ’92% mixed REOs are produced. The REO mixture from the leaching process undergoes a combined solvent extraction process at a facility in Southern China. The process inventory includes conversion to RE chlorides, repeated SX using organic solvents such as P204 and P507 and precipitation using oxalic acid. The high purity individual RE precipitate is further roasted to obtain separated pure oxides."""" Source: Arshi, P. S., Vahidi, E., & Zhao, F. (2018).
