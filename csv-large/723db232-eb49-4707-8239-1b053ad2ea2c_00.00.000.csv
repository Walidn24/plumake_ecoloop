This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'ammonium bicarbonate', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'ammonium bicarbonate'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001066-33-7. It is called 'azanium;hydrogen carbonate' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CH5NO3. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: washing & cleaning products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pH regulators and water treatment products, laboratory chemicals, leather treatment products and textile treatment products and dyes.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'ammonium bicarbonate',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'ammonium bicarbonate',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included.
