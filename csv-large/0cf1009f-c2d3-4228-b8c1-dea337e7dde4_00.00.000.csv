Air compression and auxiliary systems are included as well. Air compression provides compressed air as energy source along the production steps. Auxiliary systems provide energy for water circulation, removal of dust particles and disposal of waste.;During the initial calcination step, α-spodumene is converted into β-spodumene in a rotary kiln powered by natural gas at 1070–1100 °C. After being cooled down and crushed into smaller powder particles, β-spodumene is mixed with sulfuric acid (98.3%) and roasted at 250°C in another rotary kiln powered by natural gas. Then, lithium sulfate is leached out from the mother liquor with water during a continuous leaching stage at 60°C. Impurities like iron, aluminium, magnesium and calcium are removed by precipitation through reacting with sodium hydroxide (soda lime) and sodium carbonate (soda ash) added to the solution. The leach liquor is further purified by ion-exchange using hydrochloric acid (6%). Other purifying additives, e.g. Kieselguhr or activated charcoal, are used during the purifying filtration step. In the subsequent carbonation stage, sodium carbonate is added to the lithium-rich solution to precipitate lithium carbonate. After being dissolved in water, the solid lithium carbonate reacts with liquid carbon dioxide to generate dissolved lithium hydrogen carbonate (LiHCO3), which is finally treated with steam at 85°C and natural gas to obtain purified and dry lithium carbonate (99.9%) as a main product. The remaining mother liquor consists mainly of sodium sulfate, obtained as by-product of the entire process. Besides sodium sulfate, inert solid wastes are produced. Wastewater is collected and transported in sewers for treatment. ",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2014-01-31,2023-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
