The reaction takes place in a high-pressure tube, with pressure between 6 and 12 MPa. The exothermic reaction requires temperatures between 250 and 400 degrees Celsius. This reaction is often an adiabatic process. The product of this reaction is then decompressed and distilled. The efficiency of the reaction is over 97% (Harreus et al. 2011).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
