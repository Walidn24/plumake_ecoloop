This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'alkyd resin, long oil, without solvent, in 70% white spirit solution state', in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product ""alkyd resin, long oil, without solvent, in 70% white spirit solution state"" represents one specific long oil alkyd. The product represents the most commonly used solvent process. Its production assumes the use of soybean oil as fatty acid, phthalic anhydride as polybasic acid and Pentaeritol as polyol. Industrially, this product is mostly used in 70% solution state. Modelling this product in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models (to create the desired viscosity).

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'alkyd resin, long oil, without solvent, in 70% white spirit solution state',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'alkyd resin, long oil, without solvent, in 70% white spirit solution state',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
