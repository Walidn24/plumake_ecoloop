The cleavage of m-diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide to resorcinol and acetone is carried out under acid catalysis (1 % H2SO4) with a reaction time of 30 min. After neutralization, acetone is distilled off at normal pressure and resorcinol under vacuum. The overall process yield is ca. 75 %, based on benzene.;Acetone is a valuable by-product.;C6H6 + 2 C3H6 --> C12H18;C12H18 +2 O2 --> C6H6O2 + 2 C3H6O;References:;Schmiedel K.W., Decker D.
