The installation is fed in batch quantities. At ambient pressure the vessel is charged and then vacuum is generated. The sputtering process works by passing an electrical current through ionised gas, thus bombarding the surface of a metal cathode with ions. The atoms of the desired metal are vaporised and then deposited in a thin film on the surface of glass",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Minerals",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
