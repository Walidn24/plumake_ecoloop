This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas', in the geography of Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities from the different technologies have been estimated based on statistics from the federal government (BFE 2012) for the year 2009.  They amount to about 82% heat from oil, 13% heat from biofuels, and 5% heat from geothermal power and solar collectors. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not necessarily correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. ;BFE. 2012. Schweizerische Gesamtenergiestatistik 2012.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas',  within the geography of Switzerland.

This activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, other than natural gas', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
