This dataset represents the impacts associated to 1 ha of land use change (LUC), split between change from annual cropland, perennial cropland, primary forest, grassland, pasture man made, sugarcane and forest intensive. This dataset is specific to the country and to annual cropland.;The dataset further includes the (management practice specific) occupation impacts, i.e. the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) - based on SOCref values of Bernoux, 2001 and stock change factors of IPCC, 2006,  weighted according to management and climate categories occurrence per state (Novaes, 2017) - and nitrous oxide (N2O). The types of exchanges, their emission and calculation factors and mathematical relations are the same from land transformations datasets 'land use change, annual crop, BR, 2010 - 2015' and 'land use change, perennial crop, BR, 2010 - 2015', available in Ecoinvent database (Rossi, 2017a,b).;The amount of this product to take into account as input to the crop inventory is dependent on the percentage of expansion and productivity of the specific crop in the Brazilian state considered. The percentage of expansion can be retrieved from Novaes, et al 2017, Appendix S2, tab 'Search results', box 5.

The activity starts with the consolidation of the country specific land use changes: land transformation from primary forest, grassland, existing annual cropland, existing perennial cropland, existing sugarcane, existing pasture man made and existing forest intensive,  to annual cropland.

Included processes: land use changes (in kg NPP0), C and N emissions due to soil occupation (i.e. SOC change.)
This activity ends with the addition of land occupation-related inputs and emissions (C in soil or biomass, CO2 from air, CO2 to air and N2O to air)
Emissions from peat oxidation by drainage, gross energy and other emissions related to organic soils are not considered, because of its small representativeness in Brazil (Brasil, 2016, page 143).",00.00.000,"BRLUC,Sector: Land Use",2014-01-01,2023-12-31,"Brazil, Tocantins",ecoinvent Data Quality System
