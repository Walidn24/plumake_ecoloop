The G-S process, while capable of supplying the massive CANDU build programme from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, is expensive and requires large quantities of toxic H2S gas. It is thus a poor match for current market and regulatory conditions, and the last G-S plant in Canada shut down in 1997.;Source: http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e;Energy required for distillation is estimated from an alcohol production process  (benzyl alcohol)",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Canada,ecoinvent Data Quality System
