Synthetic graphite as active material, carbon black as conductive additive, styrene butadiene (SBR) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder are mixed in ration 94:1:2:3. Deionized water is used as solvent to prepare the anode slurry. The input materials are mixed to form a slurry, then the mixture is dried with the solvent evaporating away, cut and calendered to form the cathode of a Li-ion battery. The energy required to coat the copper conductor foil with the anode slurry is included in this dataset, because it was not possible to separate it from the energy required for the drying step.
