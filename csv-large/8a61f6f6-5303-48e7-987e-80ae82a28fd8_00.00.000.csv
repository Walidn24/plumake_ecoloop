Notably, all three possible methylamines are produced when methanol reacts with ammonia (Sutter, 2007);Detailed reaction list:;CH3OH + NH3 ⇌ CH3NH2 + H2O,    (amination reaction);CH3NH2 + CH3NH2 ⇌ (CH3)2NH + NH3,    (dismutation reaction);CH3NH2 + (CH3)2NH ⇌ (CH3)3N + NH3,    (dismutation reaction);(CH3)2NH + (CH3)2NH ⇌ (CH3)3N + CH3NH2,    (dismutation reaction);(CH3)2NH  + CH3OH ⇌ (CH3)3N + H2O,    (amination reaction);The equilibrium composition favors the formation of trimethylamine, whereas market demand is greater for mono- and especially dimethylamine. The crude reaction mixture consists essentially of excess ammonia; mono-, di-, and trimethylamines; reaction water; and unconverted methanol. Separation and purification is generally achieved in a train of four to five distillation columns, where high purity products are obtained (>99%).;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, while the catalyst was neglected.;References:;Roose, P. 2015.
