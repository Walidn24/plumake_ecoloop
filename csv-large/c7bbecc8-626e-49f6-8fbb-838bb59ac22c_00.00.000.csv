Then the deoxygenating of the stream with hydrogen takes place and the stream is cooled from 950 °C to 15 °C. After further cooling in the heat exchanger, pure argon is separated from excess hydrogen in a distillation column.;It is also possible to pass the crude argon through further rectifying columns and achieve an impurity of only 10 ppm without the use of hydrogen. In this case the consumption of hydrogen would be negligible, but the electricity demand would probably be significant. This alternative purification process is not considered in this inventory. The figure below gives a simplified scheme of the purifying process for crude argon.;Reference: Personal communication, Richard Troxler, Pangas AG Switzerland, 16.01.2002.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1997-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
