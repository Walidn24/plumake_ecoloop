The crude TiCl4 is refined further with reaction of the process being: 2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C -> 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2. Titanium tetrachloride is used for the production of the pure titanium metal (titanium sponge). The data are assumed to be valid on average for 5 years after the publication of that article.
