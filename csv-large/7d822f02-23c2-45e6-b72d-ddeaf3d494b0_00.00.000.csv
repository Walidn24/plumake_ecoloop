This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'ethoxylated alcohol (AE7)', in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;ethoxylated alcohol (AE7)'  represents an organic substance with the molecular formula CH3(CH2)4(OC2H4)OH  'produced within the reaction of a primary alcohol and ethylene oxide. It therefore comprises an ether and a hydroxy functional group. AE7 stands for alcohol, ethoxylated followed by a number indicating the average number of ethylene oxide molecules added'. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: surfactants. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'ethoxylated alcohol (AE7)',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'ethoxylated alcohol (AE7)',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
