They can be produced oleochemically or petrochemically. FAS are obtained by sulphonation of the alcohols. A thin film of alcohol is brought together with a mixture of SO3 and dry air inside a vertical tube. The heat produced by the reaction is removed using coolants outside the tube. SO3 itself is produced through a catalytic oxidisation of SO2, which derives from the combustion of sulphur or as a secondary product. After sulphonation, sodium hydroxide is applied to neutralize the acid that has been formed.;This is an average technology for the production of FAS with short chain lengh (C12-C15), representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Hirsinger F., Schick K.-P., (1995) A Life-Cycle Inventory for the Production of Alcohol Suplphates in Europe.
