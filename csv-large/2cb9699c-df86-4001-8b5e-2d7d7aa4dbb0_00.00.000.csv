The plants are used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime.;OTHER DATA:; - Share of installed capacity with desulfurisation % (figure based on IEA 212 ); - Average efficiency of desulfurisation installations: no data; - Share of installed capacity with denitrification (primary and/or secondary installations): % (figure based on IEA 212 ); - Average efficiency of denitrification installations: 6% (estimation based on Dones et al. 27, p.128. Valid for primary denitrification systems); - Share of installed capacity with particle filters: 63% (figure based on IEA 212 ); - Average efficiency of particle filters: 99.7% (figure based on IEA 212  and estimation);- IEA 2012.
