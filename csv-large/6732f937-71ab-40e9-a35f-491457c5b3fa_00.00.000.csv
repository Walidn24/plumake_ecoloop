In a second step, these fatty acids are transformed into fatty alcohols by the so-called “Lurgi direct hydrogenation”. ;Methyl ester production and hydrogenation:  in a first step, transesterification of crude or refined vegetable oils together with methanol is made and in a second step these methyl ethers are hydrogenated. It is possible to recover methanol an to return it to the first step - the transesterification.;Flow diagram of the different production ways for the production of fatty alcohols out of oleochemical raw materials :;Reference:;Noweck K.
