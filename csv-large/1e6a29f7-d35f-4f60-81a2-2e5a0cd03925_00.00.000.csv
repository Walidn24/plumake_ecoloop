Heavy ash, when transported in bulk, has a pouring density equal to or slightly above that of water, whereas the pouring density of light ash is only half of this value. Heavy ash is clearly the preferred form for economic transportation over long distances. For general chemicals production, light ash is widely used because of its traditionally lower price, its higher rate of dissolution and reaction, and its freedom from calcium ions, which are unacceptable in certain processes, as for example in soap manufacture.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1999-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
