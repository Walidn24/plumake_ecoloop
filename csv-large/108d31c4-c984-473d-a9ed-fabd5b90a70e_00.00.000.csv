This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'metal working machine, unspecified', in the Global geography.;This dataset represents the global market for metal working machine, unspecified type. Transport distances are estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a metal working machine, unspecified. 1 kg of this process is needed for 1 kg of machine.The total weigh of the machine and the amount of the products produced over its lifetime depend heavily on the production pattern. Thus, the process represents an unspecified metal machine. It includes all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and decommission.

The activity begins with the machine leaving the factory gate.

The activity ends with the machine at the site of use/installation.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Metals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
