The current proportion of desulfurisation with limestone is estimated with 80%. The additional consumption of electricity and heat for the desulfurisation process is taken into account in the net efficiency. ;The process steps are the detergent treatment, the absorption of flue gas components in the scrubbing suspension, the oxidation to sulfate (HSO3- to SO4-), the neutralization of the water suspension by the addition of limestone, crystallization of the gypsum, separation of the gypsum crystal from the mother liquor, calcination, pelleting or briquetting of gypsum for further use (IPP 1990, Baum 1988).;With limestone (CaCO3), the gases SO2, SO3, HCl and HF are absorbed in a scrubbing solution. Limestone has a low reactivity, but is preferred compared with quicklime (CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2 for economic reasons (IIP 1990). The de-dusted flue gas is either cooled in a pre-scrubber or directly cooled in the absorber. There, the hydrogen halides, the residual dust particulates and up to 20% of the SO2 are washed out. The suspension from the pre-scrubber can also be removed separately. Thus, mixing with the gypsum can be prevented. Droplet separators retain entrained liquid droplets and the clean gas is reheated and discharged through the chimney. By air intake oxidation is encouraged in the scrubber sump to form the gypsum. ;The pH-value, the ratio of the absorption liquid to the amount of exhaust gas and the concentration of absorption liquid significantly affect the separation efficiency. In (Hövelmann 1987) an efficiency of 95% is quantified. In other sources, this value is estimated at 80%. In the EU a value of 90% is obligatory, which can be achieved with a scrubber with limestone.;References:;Vernon J.L., Soud H.N. (1990) FGD installations on coal-fired plants.
