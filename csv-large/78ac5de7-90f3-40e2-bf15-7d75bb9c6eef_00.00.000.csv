In this dataset, the technology used is electrodeionization combined with some pre and post treatments as described below. Tap water is pressurized through a semi-permeable membrane by high capacity pumps where only clean water is passed through, leaving impurities to be flushed away. High Efficiency Reverse Osmosis (HERO) system has high rejection of TOC and Boron that makes it 95% efficient. This is the stage where most of the electrical power is utilized. Then water is passed through UV light to remove TOC further. Thereafter, water is passed through a membrane to virtually remove CO2 and O2. The N2 is used as a sweeping gas to mix with other gases before going to exhaust.  Subsequently water passes through a membrane electrically to separate the anion and cation, leaving product water to pass through and rejecting NaCl. This process is enhanced by a mixed bed to further remove the TDS and silica. The resistivity of the water is monitored to change the exhausted resins. Finally, water is filtered by a 0.2-micron cartridge filter and then 0.04-micron cartridge filter before being sent to the point of use. ;Supandy, M. (2009).

EDI combines mixed-bed ion exchange with electrochemistry to split a feed stream into a product and concentrate stream.;The EDI unit works by placing a mixed-bed ion exchange resin between two special membranes that allow the migration of only cations or anions. Several mixed bed resin/membrane layers are placed between an anode and cathode, a direct current is applied between both electrodes. The influent is then passed through the mixed bed, where the cations migrate to the cathode through the cation membrane into the cation concentrate stream, while the anions migrate to the anode through the anion membrane into the anion concentrate stream. The concentrates are collected and led to the discharge effluent. Water is also electrolytically spit into H+ and OHâ€“ ions, thus providing a simultaneous regeneration mechanism for the cation and anion resin that does not require chemicals.;Electrodeionization units have several advantages; such as continuous operation without regeneration, no regeneration chemicals, and relatively small power requirements. Disadvantages of EDI units were initially high capital costs, mechanical/electrical complications, low flow rates, and susceptibility to fouling. Current EDI technology has equalized the capital costs to that of a mixed-bed, and flow capacity has been increased to be comparable to mixed-bed ion exchange columns for some applications.;;Hussey, D., Foutch, G., Ward, M.: Water, ultrapure.
