Furthermore, high capacity plants generate high purity sodium cyanide via evaporation of water and crystallization (Kirk, 2004). A crucial aspect is the system's control to maximize the sodium formate formation by avoiding the hydrogen cyanide polymer formation.;In this dataset, a yield of 99% was assumed, as per the literature mentioned above.;References:;Kirk, Raymond E., Donald F.
