This dataset represents the manufacturing of aluminium cast alloy by direct chilled horizontal continuous casting from primary liquid aluminium. This process can also be used for production of bus bar, anode beams and anode studs for aluminium smelters or substation. Hot liquid primary aluminium transported by truck using crucibles is used as the main aluminium bearing input (90-95%). The liquid aluminium is pre-treated in reverberatory furnace were pre-heated aluminium scrap, aluminum based alloy additives and pure metals are added to obtain desired alloy composition. Scrap aluminium is used as aluminium input up to 5%. Alloy composition represented in this dataset is mainly cast alloy product from the 1xx.x series (minimum 99% aluminium), but alloy composition that can reach up to 5% of final alloy. Molten aluminium alloy is degassed with argon and cast by direct chilled horizontal continuous casting. Final product is cut to the desired length. Duration of casting varies from 2 Tons per hour to 6 Tons per hour depending on end product desired. Wastewater from chilling is treated on site by diffused air filtration and is mainly recirculated in closed-loop. The operations covered by this dataset include: pre-treatment of hot metal, recovery and handling of internal process scrap, batching, alloying, metal treatment, casting operations, sawing and cooling activities, maintenance and repair of plant and equipment, treatment of process air, liquids and solids.  

Activity starts with the arrival of hot liquid aluminium input and other additives at reverbatory furnace.

This activity ends with cooling of casted product by direct chilled horizontal casting. The dataset includes material and energy related to the alloy production and casting: scrap and primary metal input, preheating, melting in reverbatory furance, alloying, degassing, water use and casting). It also includes waste treatment and onsite wastewater treatment.
