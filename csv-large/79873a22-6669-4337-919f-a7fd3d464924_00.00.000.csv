Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of 'sewage sludge, dried' from activities that produce it within the geography of GLO. Transportation is included in this market. The transport amounts are based on the default transport distances for markets, provided in the 'Default Transport Assumptions' file available on the ecoinvent website (https://www.ecoinvent.org/support/documents-and-files/documents-and-files.html). See exchange comments for additional details.
