Naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid is produced by adding naphthalene to 96 % sulfuric acid at 20 °C and slowly raising the temperature to 70 °C. After 3 h at 70 – 75 °C the reaction mass is poured into water and limed out. A technical-grade product is obtained by evaporation and a purer product by precipitating the aniline salt.;An alternative sulfonation process uses sulfur trioxide in a solvent such as tetrachloroethane.;Naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid is further sulfonated or nitrated without isolation. At lower temperature (35 °C), sulfuric acid with oleum yields the 1,5-disulfonic acid, whereas at higher temperature (100 °C) the 1,6-disulfonic acid is predominantly obtained. Nitration gives mainly the 5-nitro and 8-nitro derivatives (see Section Production and Properties). Production of 1-naphthol by caustic fusion (hydroxylation) has long since been superseded by alternatives for reasons of product quality (Section 1-Naphthol). A continuous process for the production of hexamethyldisilazane consisting of the concurrent actions of continuously introducing predetermined quantities per time unit of trimethylchlorosilane and gaseous ammonia to form a mixture of hexamethyldisilazane and ammonium chloride in a first reactor while simultaneously subjecting said mixture to continuous high shear agitation, for a time period related to the volume of the reactor and the quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia introduced, to form a slurry; and simultaneously separating the ammonium chloride from said slurry to provide a solution principally comprising hexamethyldisilazane, while continuing to introduce a continuous flow of further quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia as the hexamethyldisilazane is removed. ;References:;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
