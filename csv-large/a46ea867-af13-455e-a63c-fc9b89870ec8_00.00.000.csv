The plants are used for middle load with 4000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 150000 hours during its lifetime.;Coal power plants are installed with an electrical filter and a flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx). To a large extent a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) takes place and a DeNOx plant is installed additionally. The electrical filter is the most widely used technology in UCTE countries. The system is highly efficient with filtration efficiency up to 99.9%. The electrical filter increases the energy consumption. The downstream flue gas desulfurization (DeSOx) reduces the particles further by 80% to 95%.; - Dones, R., Bauer, C., Röder, A. (2007) Kohle. In: Dones, R.
