The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 90.6 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 0%-11.2%-88.8%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0.1625kg O. The generated waste-specific raw sludge mass (dry matter) is 0.2453kg DM. 89% of the raw sludge (DM) is treated with anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces 156.6 litres of biogas with an energy content of 3.625MJ. 23.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 26.564%. The gross thermal efficiency is 47.853%. After digestion, the remaining total sludge mass (dry matter) is 0.1288kg DM.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
