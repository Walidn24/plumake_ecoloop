In the first step CS2 and ammonia gas are reacted in the presence of water over activated charcoal at ca. 50 °C in an in-terface reactor to give ammonium dithiocarbamate. ;The latter is decomposed in the second step at 95 – 100 °C on activated charcoal. ;If the NH3 and CS2 used are of high purity, the 35 – 45 % ammonium thiocyanate solution formed can be marketed after concentration without further purification. The crystals, which are produced by vacuum evaporation and centrifugation, are of higher purity. In this process, apart from H2S and excess CS2, no other waste substances are formed. After CS2 and H2S have been separated, the former can be recycled and the latter can be used, for example, for sulfur production in the Claus process. ;;;Claus process:;;2H2S + O2 → 2S + 2H2O;;;From sulfur carbon disulfide is produced. The; CS2 production reaction is:;;;CH4 + 4 S → CS2 + 2 H2S;;;There is also a one-step variant of this process in which the reaction of NH3 with CS2 and decomposition take place at ca. 115 °C and 5 bar.;The whole chemical equation with included desulfurizing and CS2-production from the recovered sulfur is:;;;CS2 + 4 NH3 + 2 O2 + CH4→ 2NH4SCN + 4H2O;Hoek, Theo van: Thiocyanates, Inorganic.
