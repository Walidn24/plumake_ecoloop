In a first step, hydrogen peroxide is produced by reducing alkylanthraquinone with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to the hydrochinone. Then the catalyst is removed and the hydrochinone is oxidised – usually with air – back to the origin quinone and in the same time hydrogen peroxide is produced. The quinones can then be re-hydrolysed again. The whole reaction takes place in a working solution that consists of a mixture of various solvents (i.e. parts are aromatic solvents). The whole process is exothermic. In a second step, hydrogen peroxide is extracted from the working solution and concentrated. Both steps are included in this dataset.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1995-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
