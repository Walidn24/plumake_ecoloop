Sublimation of the powders and condensation of the vapours on a glass substrate by vapour transport deposition (VTD).;In the first step, float glass is fed into the continuous assembly line followed by vapor transport deposition of semiconductor and recrystallization treatment.  In the second step, laser scribing is applied to separate the semiconductor film into solar cells and back contact metals are deposited. In the third step, busbar, back glass, encapsulant, junction box, aluminum frame, and product label are applied to create a finished product.
