This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'diethylene glycol', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;diethylene glycol'  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000111-46-6. It is called '2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethanol' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C4H10O3. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with no distinct odour. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: coating products, inks and toners, non-metal-surface treatment products, polishes and waxes, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, adhesives and sealants, washing & cleaning products, biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), polymers, anti-freeze products, leather treatment products and textile treatment products and dyes. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'diethylene glycol',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'diethylene glycol',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
