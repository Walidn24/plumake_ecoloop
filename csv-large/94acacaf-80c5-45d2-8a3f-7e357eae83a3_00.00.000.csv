This dataset is a market group. Market groups represent a 'market of markets'. Their purpose is to group a set of markets into larger, geographically relevant datasets.;Market groups are created for convenience and ease of use. They only group other markets and/or market groups contained within their geography.;Losses and relevant exchanges (transport, transport infrastructure, etc.) are not included in this dataset. They are present in the contained markets.  ;This is the market group for 'electricity, low voltage', in European Network of Transmission Systems Operators for Electricity.

This activity starts at the gate of markets that deliver 'electricity, low voltage', in geographies contained within the geography of this dataset.

This activity ends with the supply of 'electricity, low voltage',  to the consumers of this product within the geography of European Network of Transmission Systems Operators for Electricity.",00.00.000,Sector: Electricity,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,European Network of Transmission Systems Operators for Electricity,ecoinvent Data Quality System
