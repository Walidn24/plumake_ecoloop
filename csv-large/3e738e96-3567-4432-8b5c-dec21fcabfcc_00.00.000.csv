In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors. Electric traction, diesel traction for shunting processes, average share of particle filters. The module energy use of goods trains comprises both, the actual performance of goods trains as well as required shunting processes. For a technical and ecological consideration of rail transport services, a distinction between the type of traction, diesel and electricity is important. In Switzerland, however, diesel locomotives are almost exclusively used for shunting purposes. The data presented in the database represents average environmental interventions, calculated top down from the yearly energy consumption and yearly transport performance. For electricity consumption of freight trains, yearly average data is available from the SBB (SBB, 2002). The actual consumption depends on numerous impact factors such as: • Gradient of the tracks • Type of good, i.e. relation between operation performance and transport performance • Train length and total weight • Speed and acceleration In an alpine country as Switzerland, this can result in a significantly higher specific electricity consumption compared to fairly flat countries such as the Netherlands or Germany. Borken (2003), for instance, calculate a final energy consumption for an average train (1000 Gt) and average load factor (0.5 net tons-per gross tons) of 0.034 kWh/tkm in a flat area and 0.051 kWh/tkm in a mountain region. The remaining difference between the latter value and the SBB value may be explained with the lower average load factor of the SBB in 2000 (0.42 t/Gt). Transmission losses (transmission ex traction substation 4% and transmission and conversion ex high voltage network 6%) are accounted for with 10%, resulting in a final energy consumption of 0.07804 kWh/tkm for the SBB (reference year 2006). Due to the fact that on the Swiss rail network only very few diesel locomotives are in operation emissions to air are limited to particulate emissions due to abrasion and emission of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) occurring during conversion at traction substations. Source of abrasion are rail tracks, wheels, brakes, overhead contact line and exhaust emissions of shunting locomotives. The figures presented here, therefore should only be considered as rough estimates. For the determination of PM 10 emission factors are used for brakes, wheels, rail and overhead contacting line. For the determination of PM > 10 we assume a share of 25 % for wheel and rail abrasion. The abrasion of brakes and the resulting share of PM 10 depend on the wheel load and thus differ between fully loaded goods trains and empty goods train. The figure employed in this project represents an average based on the load factor of 0.42 for the Swiss average freight train. For sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emitted during conversion at traction substations is assumed an emission index of 4.4E-08 kg/kWh Frischknecht (2003) resulting in a specific emission of 3.79E-09 kg/tkm. Abrasion (from braking lining, rail and wheel) is predominately composed of iron and mineral components BUWAL (2002). In this study is assumed that all non-airborne emissions are emitted as iron to soil. In consequence, is assumed a yearly load of 191.8 t/a iron emitted to soil. Emission of lubricates due to traction are not accounted for, since measures are in operation to avoid such emissions. A total diesel consumption of 8.695 Mio litres (in the year 2000) is reported for the SBB (SBB, 2002). In this study is assumed that all diesel is consumed for shunting, neglecting the consumption of diesel for the lorry fleet and diesel aggregates. Furthermore is assumed that 100% of the shunting processes for goods trains is performed with diesel locomotives. Consequently, is obtained a specific diesel consumption of 0.68 g/tkm. In Knörr (2000), shunting specific emission indices are presented. These emission factors are representative for German conditions in 1995. Obviously these indices merely differ marginal from those of diesel traction in Germany J. Borken et al. (2003), apart from SO2 emissions, which strongly depend on the sulphur of the fuel. In this project CO2 and SO2 indices are estimated assuming that all carbon and sulphur in the fuel is transformed completely into CO2 and SO2, respectively. In line with assumptions made for road transport we assume a sulphur content of 300 ppm resulting in a emission index of 0.6 g/kg. For CO2 is employed an emission index of 73.5 g/MJ or 3146 g/kg. The list of emission indices is enhanced with pollutants derived from heavy good vehicle emission factors for urban traffic conditions. These values reflect the Swiss average heavy good vehicle in urban traffic conditions and are derived from INFRAS (1999).;References:;SBB (2002) Umweltbericht 2000/2001.
