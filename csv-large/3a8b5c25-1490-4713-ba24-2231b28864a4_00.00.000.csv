The hydrothermal process requires the use of reactants such as lithium hydroxide, phosphoric acid and iron sulfate, and heating of water in addition to the reactants. ;;The general reaction is the following: ;3LiOH(aq) + H3PO4(aq) + FeSO4(aq) --> LiFePO4(s) + Li2SO4(aq) + 3H2O;Reference: ;;Dunn, J., James, C., Gaines, L., & Gallagher, K.
