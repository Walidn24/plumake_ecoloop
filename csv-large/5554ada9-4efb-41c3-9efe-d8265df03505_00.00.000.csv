This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'polycarbonate' from activities that produce it within the geography RER.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;'polycarbonate', is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% virgin material with no content of recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: alternative for glass for applications (eyewear, bulletproof glass) building and construction sector (e.g., improving insulation and lightning), electrical and electronics (e.g., large flat screens and monitors, Digital Disks, consumer electronics equipment and fuse boxes as well as the large market of optical data storage), automotive industry (e.g., mirror and headlamp houses), domestic appliances, packaging, 3D printed models, medical devices as well as leisure and safety (e.g., goggles, helmet).

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'polycarbonate',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'polycarbonate',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
