This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'sodium nitrite', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;sodium nitrite'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007632-00-0. It is called 'sodium;nitrite' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: NNaO2. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure , it appears as white to yellowish crystals, which are soluble in water, ethanol, and methanol. It is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: anti-freeze products, adhesives and sealants, coating products, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, finger paints, metal surface treatment products, non-metal-surface treatment products, inks and toners and lubricants and greases. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'sodium nitrite',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'sodium nitrite',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
