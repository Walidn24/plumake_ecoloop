Production of C5-alcohols from fusel oils by fermentation has been replaced mainly by the oxo synthesis and currently has little industrial importance. Production of pentanols from pentane by the Sharples process (chlorination of pentanes and subsequent hydrolysis) has also been largely replaced by oxo synthesis.;Hydration of pentenes;2-methyl-2-butanol is produced mainly by hydration of 2-methyl-2-butene (isopentene). There are;several processes which use different catalysts, e. g. acid ion exchangers, zeolites, layer silicates, formic;acid, HCl, SbCl3, ZnCl2, or acetic acid.;Reaction:;C5H10 + H2O --> C5H12O;As there was no data available for the production of 2-methyl-2-butanol, the values for the consumption of the raw materials are calculated with an assumed yield of 95 % (Frischknecht et al. 2007). At the same time, the values for the energy use have been estimated with data from Chauvel 1989, who gives data for the production of isopropanol from the hydration of isopropylene. Hence, this process is considered to be similar to the hydration of 2-methyl-2-butene.;Reference:;Lappe, P., Hoffmann, T.: Pentanols.
