This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer', in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;'ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer', is a plastic product of fossil origin, it is not biodegradable and it is a thermoplastic material. This product consists of 100% virgin material with no content of recycled material. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: packaging and plastic goods industries, sealants in meat and dairy packaging structures, footwear, wire and cable insulation, pipes, toys, corks, photovoltaic encapsulation, medical packaging, hot melt adhesives, and lamination of glass to improve impact resistance.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
