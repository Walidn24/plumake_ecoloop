This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;The shares of heat supplying activities with combined heat and power (CHP) plants and pure heat power plants have been estimated. On a small level, more heat is produced in heat plants than in CHP plants. The shares are assumed to amount to 25% heat from CHP plants and 75% heat from heat plants. The shares of the individual supplying activities do not correspond to reality and will have to be refined in future. ;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through the burning of natural gas in heat and power co-generation units and several types of boilers. The dataset is targeted for central or small-scale heating.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, central or small-scale, natural gas',  within the geography of Europe without Switzerland.

This activity ends with the supply of  heat, central or small-scale, natural gas', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe without Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
