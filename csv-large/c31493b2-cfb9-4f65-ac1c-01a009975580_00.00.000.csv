Acetone is condensed with a base catalyst to yield isophorone. Isophorone is reacted with hydrogen cyanide to isophoronnitrile, this is further reacted with ammonium and hydrogen to give isophorondiamine. In a last step, isophorondiamine is phosgenated to result in isophorondiisocyanate. A yield of 95% per reaction step was assumed.;3C3H6O+OH- (cat) -> C9H14O+2H2O+OH- (cat);C9H14O+HCN -> C10H15NO;C10H15NO+NH3+3H2 -> C10H22N2+H2O;C10H22N2+2COCl2 -> C12H18N2O2+2HCl;Sodium hydroxide is added to neutralize the formed hydrochloric acid. The catalyst in not consider significant in terms of emissions for the reaction and it is therefore not included in the dataset.;Reference(s):;Six C., Richter F., (2005).
