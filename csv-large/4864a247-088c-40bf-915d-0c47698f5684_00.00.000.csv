This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for 'calcium chloride', in the Global geography. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;calcium chloride'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 010043-52-4. It is called 'calcium dichloride' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: CaCl2. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, is odourless and may have a flaky/powder form. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: washing & cleaning products, anti-freeze products, fertilisers, plant protection products, adsorbents, water treatment chemicals and heat transfer fluids. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: pH regulators and water treatment products, washing & cleaning products, adsorbents, laboratory chemicals and anti-freeze products. This substance is used for the synthesis of other substances (use as intermediate).

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'calcium chloride',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'calcium chloride',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
