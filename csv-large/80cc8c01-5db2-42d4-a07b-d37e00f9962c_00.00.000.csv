After the process reaction excess ammonia and amine is recycled amine and trimethylamine is recovered in a distilling column. The inventory bases on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt.% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the waste water in a internal waste water treatment plant assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C, 70% for NH4-N and 50% for N-tot). The used reaction catalysts in the process (aluminium silicate or phosphate) were neglected.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1991-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
