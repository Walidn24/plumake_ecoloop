Heat is removed from a process stream, attaining temperatures below ambient, by circulating a working fluid (refrigerant) through a typical compression system. The absorption of heat, from a process stream, is attained through the evaporation of a liquid refrigerant, at a low temperature, in a heat exchanger. Subsequently, the vapour stream is compressed to a pressure high enough to allow for condensation. The temperature increases as well because of the compression step attaining a superheated vapour state. Subsequently, the refrigerant, as a saturated vapour, passes through a condenser to become a saturated liquid. The refrigerant is then fed into an expansion valve where its pressure is reduced. Due to the adiabatic flash, the temperature of the refrigerant is drastically reduced leading to its partial vaporization. Finally, the liquid-vapour mixture enters the evaporator and completes the cycle.;This activity represents the production of 1 MJ of cooling energy for process source temperatures at –100°C,  based on a compression refrigeration system with a capacity of 1 MW. The cooling energy is produced via a two-stage compression refrigeration system with propylene and ethylene as refrigerants. Input data to formulate this activity originate from Luyben, W. L (2017), Eunomia (2014), and IPCC/TEAP (2005).;References:;Luyben, William L. ""Estimating refrigeration costs at cryogenic temperatures.""
