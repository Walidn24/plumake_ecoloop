During the charge process, lithium ion move from the cathode (LiMn2O4) into the electrolyte (LiPF6 in ethylenecarbonate) through the micropores of the separator into the anode (lithium ion intercalation). During the discharge of the battery the Li+-ions move back into the cathode. The modelled battery has a mass of 280 kg, contains 216 cells and holds a capacity of 32 kWh. Data are based measurements and scaled to 1kg of battery. The battery pack contains a battery management system.
