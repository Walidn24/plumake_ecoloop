This dataset represents the production of HCl via the combustion of chlorine with hydrogen gas. The process involves burning hydrogen gas and chlorine in a gas combustion chamber, producing hydrogen chloride gas. The hydrogen chloride gas then passes through a cooler to an absorber where process water is introduced, producing aqueous hydrochloric acid.;H2 + Cl2 ->  2 HCl (exothermic reaction);References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
