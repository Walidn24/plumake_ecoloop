This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid'  is an organic substance with a CAS no. : 000067-43-6. It is called '2-[bis[2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]acetic acid' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: C14H23N3O10. It is solid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and it has no odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: coating products, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, polishes and waxes, textile treatment products and dyes, washing & cleaning products, air care products, adhesives and sealants, biocides (e.g. disinfectants, pest control products), metal surface treatment products, non-metal-surface treatment products, pH regulators and water treatment products and leather treatment products. There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on industrial sites.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
