This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant'  in the Global geography.;Transporting hydrogen via standard shipping methods is difficult and dangerous. The default estimation for the sector is therefore adapted. Transport by ship is completely removed.;;'hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure, merchant' is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 001333-74-0. It is called 'molecular hydrogen' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: H2. It is gaseous under applied medium pressure and has no odor. It is modelled as a pure substance. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the solvent of their choice in their models. On a consumer level, is used in the following products: fuels and related products, water treatment products. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: Fuels and fuel additives, functional fluids (closed systems), intermediates, laboratory chemicals, odor agents, oxidizing/reducing agents, processing aids, specific to petroleum production.

The activity begins with the product leaving the production site.

This activity ends with the supply of 'hydrogen, gaseous, medium pressure',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
