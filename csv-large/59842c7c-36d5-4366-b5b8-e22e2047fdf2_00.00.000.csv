This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'dust collector, electrostatic precipitator, for domestic use', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a dust collector, electrostatic precipitator, for domestic use that can be connected to a stove or furnaces for residential wood combustion with thermal capacity less than 35kW. It has an air flow capacity of 1.4 liters per second and a lifetime of 20 years. The process includes all materials necessary to construct it, energy consumption during manufacturing and decommission.   

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
