Either arc furnaces or resistance furnaces, analogous to Acheson furnaces for SiC, are used. The starting material is an intimate mixture of boric oxide and carbon, e.g., petroleum coke or graphite. Large quantities of carbon monoxide, 2.3 m3/kg, are generated, and boron can be lost by evaporation of B2O3 at the high temperatures. In the electrothermic process used by ESK, a subsidiary of Wacker Chemie, the product is cooled, and the unconverted outer-zone material is removed to leave a fused coarse-grained boron carbide of high purity: B plus C ≥ 99 wt %, total metal impurity ≤ 0.2 wt %, N plus O ≤ 0.3 wt %, B : C mole ratio of 4.0 – 4.3. This boron carbide is obtained in the form of regular blocks, which are broken up and milled to produce the B4C grain size appropriate for final use.;If the carbothermic reduction is carried out below the melting point of B4C, e.g., at 1600 – 1800 °C, in a vented graphite tube furnace starting from a dehydrated mixture of H3BO3, acetylene black or sugar, and ethylene glycol, very fine-grained (0.5 – 5 µm), stoichiometric B4C powders are produced, although productivity is low.;Uniformly sized submicrometer powders of boron carbide (specific surface area 20–35 m2/g) can be synthesized continuously by rapid carbothermic reduction (RCR) of boron oxide in a graphite transport reactor at ca. 2000°C.; ; ;;;;Baudis, U., Fichte, R.: Boron and Boron Alloys.
