This dataset covers the treatment of dried timber with organic salt (Cu-HDO) with the oscillating pressure method. ;Wood is not included in the dataset. ;Pressure processes have been used for more than 150 years for impregnating wood with preservatives. The choice of the pressure process depends on the intended use, the nature and quality of the preservative, and the moisture level of the wood at the time of treatment.;In the vacuum pressure process (also called full-cell process or saturation impregnation), air present in the dried wood is removed with a high initial vaccum, then the impregnation cylinder is filled with the preservative solution while the vaccum is maintained. Finally, after air is admitted to the cyclinder, an impregnation pressure is produced and maintained for a defined period, depending on the ease of impregnation of the wood. Generally pressures >0.9 MPa are applied. The pressure is maintained until virtually no more liquid is absorbed by the wood. In some plants, this is controlled automatically via an end-phase counter, which determines the quantity of preservative that can still be absorbed by the wood. Application of a short final vacuum should decrease the extend of dripping of the impregnation solution from the wood after it is removed from the cyclinder. This process was introduced by Bréant in 1831 for impregnation with salts, and by Bethell in 1838 for impregnation with tar oils.  ;;;;Depending on the use class envisaged for the treated timber, the following preservative inputs can be assumed (for softwood): use class 3: 6 kg/m3; use class 4: 8 kg/m3 (excluding uses with an expected service life > 15 years);;The basic equipment for a plant for the vaccum pressure method consists fo a impregnating cylinder with one or two seals, one or more storage vessel sfor various wood preservatives or solutions of different concentrations, a ppressure pump, a vacuum pump, measuirng and dissolving vessels, and a control device for maintaining impregnation conditions.;;;Most plants are now controlled automatically with fixed programs an can preoduce full impregnation protocols independently. The vacuum pressure method (or full-cell process) is applied mainly for water-soluble wood preservatives. Coal-tar oils and solvent-containing preparations are seldom used because preservative absorption is too high.;;The process does not cause any waste water; preservatives from dripping or leaching during storage are recovered and recycled. Emissions into surface water from run-off water are calculated based on emission factors (EF) as determined in OECD (2000, part 1, p. 46ff), depending on the physical properties of the main componentes of the wood preservative. It is assumed in addition that all solvents (incl. water) are evaporated during drying and fixation. For acids and salts, no emissions into air are inventoried. The determination of emission factors is documented in the following table:;;For detailed modelling and scenario assumptions, see dataset.;Sources: OECD (2000): Emission scenario document for wood preservatives, part 1.

Service starting with the reception of the wood preservative at the factory gate

The data set contains the treatment service of dried wood with wood preservative based on organic copper salts (Cu-HDO) with the vacuum pressure method. It covers the necessary inputs of the wood preservative, electricity, ingredients for waste water/surface water treatment as well as some infrastructure. For the inventorying of emissions into surface water and air, see general comment.The dataset does not include wood. Also eventual waste streams (e.g. saw dust recollected from the pressure vessel) are not included. ",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
