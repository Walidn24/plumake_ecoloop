At present there are only two processes of substantial industrial importance: the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride and the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde. Other processes, like the oxidation of toluene, the hydrogenation of benzoic acid esters, the electrochemical reduction of benzoic acid, the hydrolysis of benzylsulfonic acid, and the decarboxylation of benzyl formate, have no importance in the industrial production of benzyl alcohol. The hydrolysis of benzyl chloride is a reversible reaction which leads to the almost quantitative formation of benzyl alcohol only in the presence of alkaline saponifying agents that combine with the hydrogen chloride as it is formed. It is therefore carried out by heating benzyl chloride with stoichiometric excesses of aqueous solutions of oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates of the alkali or alkaline earth metals. ;To 610 parts of boiling 10 % soda solution 126.5 parts of benzyl chloride is added with stirring. The reaction mixture is refluxed and stirred until carbon dioxide no longer escapes; this takes an average of five to six hours. An alkali-resistant steel reactor with brick walls is used. The stirrer and heating coil are made of an alloy with a high nickel content. After the reaction mixture has cooled, the upper layer, consisting of crude benzyl alcohol, is removed. The sodium chloride solution below still contains some soda. Dissolved benzyl alcohol can be obtained from it by adding salt or by extracting with benzene or toluene. The crude benzyl alcohol is carefully fractionated at a reduced pressure in an efficient column. The yield is 85 parts of benzyl alcohol and 10 parts of dibenzyl ether. ;Reference:;Br√ºhne, F., Wright: Benzyl alcohol.
