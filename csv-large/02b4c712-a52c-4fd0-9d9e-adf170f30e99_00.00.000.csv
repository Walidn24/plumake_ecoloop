Spinell type lithium manganese oxide acts as a Li+-ion accumulator. Free Li+-ions move out of the spinell type LiMn2O4 (charge) to the electrolyte or from the electrolyte back to the LiMn2O4 spinell (discharge). ,00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Electronics; Metals",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
