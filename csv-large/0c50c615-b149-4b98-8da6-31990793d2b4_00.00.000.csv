This global dataset is a copy of the regional MG dataset, except for the following modifications.;The production volume represents the global annual production.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.;Yield of the global dataset = 15000 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the MG regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 vanilla seedling raised in a nursery during one year. From a vanilla nursery of 1 ha, seedlings for 10 ha productive vanilla fields (estimate) can be obtained, i.e. a total of 15'000 seedlings are obtained from 1 ha nursery.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) =2.7 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters

The activity starts with soil cultivation of the field in order to establish a onion nursery for 1 year.

The inventory includes all activities of a year in the productive phase as well as transport on farm. Cultivation is extensive; no irrigation, fertilisers or pesticides are applied. Planting and harvest are done manually. Drying is at ambient temperature. Direct field emissions from crop production activities (e.g. fertiliser and pesticide use) and land use change are considered.
The activity ends with harvesting vanilla seedlings.",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
