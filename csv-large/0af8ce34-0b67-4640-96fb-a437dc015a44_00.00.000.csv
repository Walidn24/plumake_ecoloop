The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a supranational region average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 82.2 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 8.2%-41.2%-50.6%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 0.000979486 kg O. The digestion process produces 1.01505735 litres of biogas with an energy content of 0.019643575MJ. 60.5% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 0%. The gross thermal efficiency is 0%. After digestion, the remaining total sludge mass (dry matter) is 0.1624kg DM.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
