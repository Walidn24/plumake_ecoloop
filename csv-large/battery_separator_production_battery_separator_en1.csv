In case of too high process temperature of the battery, the separator melts, thus closes the micopores, and interrupts the lithium ions exchange. In this way the chemical process is stopped and the cell is prevented from overheating or burning. ;;The wet process via which separators are produced involves several steps: (1) mixing of a polyolefin resin e.g. polyethylene with plasticizers or low-molecular-weight substances, such as paraffin oil or wax, (2) melting of the mixture, (3) extruding the mixture into a gel-like film, (4) stretching of the film,  and finally (5) extracting the plasticizer with volatile solvents to form micropores.
