The ethylene conversion is only of 4% per passage. The reaction gas is recycled many times to increase total efficiency. The ethylene has to be of high purity to avoid inert gases concentration. The reaction gas is cooled to condense the liquid products and separate it from the ethylene to be recycled. Ethanol solution is concentrated and purified by extractive distillation. The ethanol selectivity is about 98%. Co-products of the direct hydration are diethyl ether (1 %), butene (0.6 %), and acetaldehyde (0.2 %). The diethyl ether is purificated in the ether distillation column. The other organic byproducts are recovered and fed into the steam generator.;The figure below represents the production of ethanol by means of the direct hydration of ethanol. ;a) Circulation compressor; b) Heat exchanger; c) Superheater; d) Reactor; e) Washer; f) Crude ethanol tank; g) Extractive distillation column; h) Concentration column; i) Dehydration; j) Concentration column;Reference:;Heitmann, W., Strehlke, G., Mayer, D.: Ethers, aliphatic, Chapter 2,4.
