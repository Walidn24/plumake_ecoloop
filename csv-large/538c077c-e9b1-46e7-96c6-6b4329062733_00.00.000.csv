The stoichiometric equation is the following: HfCl4 + 2 Mg → Hf + 2 MgCl2. The produced hafnium sponge undergoes vacuum distillation, where the sponge is purified by removing the magnesium chloride, which is then separated via the electrolysis process, producing magnesium and chlorine (MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2). After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals; Chemicals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,France,ecoinvent Data Quality System
