The reaction mixture exits the reactor through a decompression chamber. In addition to N,N-dimethylformamide, the crude product contains methanol, a certain amount of unreacted N,N-dimethylamine, dissolved carbon monoxide, and residual catalyst. The addition of acid or water deactivates any catalyst present, resulting in the formation of sodium formate. Dissolved carbon monoxide, together with inert gases, escapes from the mixture during decompression, and the off-gases are removed by combustion. Preliminary distillation is followed by a second distillation in a separate column; here, dimethylformamide is separated from methanol which contains traces of N,N-dimethylamine. Further distillation results in a product of 99.9 % purity.;Alternative synthesis technology:;The two steps process differs from direct synthesis because methyl formate is prepared separately and introduced in the form of ca. 96 % pure (commercial grade) material (Ullmann, 2004). Equimolar amounts of methyl formate and N,N-dimethylamine are subjected to a continuous reaction at 60 – 100 °C and 0.1 – 0.3 MPa. The resulting product is a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and methanol. The purification process involves distillation and is analogous to that described for direct synthesis. However, no separation of salts is required because no catalysts are involved in the process. According to the corrosive properties of both starting materials and products, stainless steel has to be used as material of construction for production facilities.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Bipp H., Kieczka, H.: Formamides.
