This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'ventilation system, decentralized, 6 x 120 m3/h, steel ducts, with earth tube heat exchanger', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a ventilation system, decentralized, 6 x 120 m3/h, steel ducts, with earth tube heat exchanger that is used in a multi family house. The house considered in the investigation includes 6 flats with 130 m2 floor area each and a ventilation rate of 120 m3/h. The infrastructure represents a decentralised ventilation system with 4 parallel polyethylene ground heat exchanger tubes (200 mm diameter). Air distribution to the 6 decentral ventilation units with a galvanised steel tube (400 mm diameter). Distribution of fresh- and exhaust-air within the flat with galvanised steel ducts (100x50 mm). Exhaust air from the 6 decentral ventilation units with a galvanised steel tube (400 mm diameter) to the exhaust on the roof. The lifetime is assumed to be 50 years. The process includes building materials and their decommission.

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
