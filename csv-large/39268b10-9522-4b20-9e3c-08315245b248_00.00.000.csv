One major German pant alone produces some 60’000 tonnes annually.;Commercial production of MCA is by direct chlorination of acetic acid or by conversion of di-chloroacetic acid to MCA by hydrogen reduction. Most MCA is produced for captive use. ;Direct chlorination of acetic acid (industry sources):;Acetic acid, mixed with 5% acetic anhydride, is fed into a reactor. Chlorine is fed into the bottom and is converted to gaseous hydrochloric acid (HCl). The HCl gas is absorbed by water to form aqueous hydrochloric acid. The product solution is distilled. The resulting crude chloroacetic acid is mixed with water, and cooled in a crystallizer to recover solid MCA. The remaining dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is removed and hydrogenated to MCA. ;Cl2 + CH3COOH    ClCH2COOH + HCl 	(production of MCA);2 Cl2 + CH3COOH   Cl2CHCOOH + 2 HCl 	(production of DCA);2 H2 + 2 Cl2CHCOOH     2 ClCH2COOH + 2 HCl 	(hydrogenation of DCA to MCA);;References:;Chemical Profiles	Chemical profiles are published weekly in the Chemical Market Reporter, a pub-lication of the Schnell Publishing Company, a member of the Reed Elsevier group.;;Clartext 4/2002	Hanisch, C.: “Kein Hauch von Essigduft: Monochloressigsäure aus Knapsack”",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1997-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
