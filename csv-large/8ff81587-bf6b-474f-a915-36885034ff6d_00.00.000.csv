The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. The treatment of the waste water in an internal waste water treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Electricity is needed to run the process auxiliaries and the wastewater treatment. Fossil fuel is needed to generate the desired heat within the process scheme.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
