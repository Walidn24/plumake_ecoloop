It applies fractionation to separate different quantities from the raw material and thereby aiming to optimise the value added. In Switzerland, a grass-refinery plant was in operation between January 2001 and summer 2003 in Schaffhausen. A comprehensive grass-refinery process, as shown in the figure below, was designed to produce three products: biogas, fibres and proteins.;Potential products and their application are briefly described:;a. Grass fibres;Grass fibres can be recovered at a length of 2-30 mm. Variation is due to raw material variation and process conditions. Grass fibres are suitable and competitive for short fibre applications. The following products can be made from grass fibres:;• Insulation products.;o Insulation boards can be produced in a density range between 60 and 160 kg/m3. The heat conductivity is 0.04-0.045 W/mK, depending on the density of the board. Resistance against fire and fungi can be achieved using additives. Advantages compared with mineral wool include the high specific heat capacity, which results in a 10-12 hours delayed release of outside heat to the inside and improved summer heat protection.;Boards can be used for thermal insulation in ventilated facades and cavity masonry, steep-pitched roofs, over rafters and for sound insulation. Possible applications of grass-based insulation boards cover around 80% of all insulation applications.;o Blow-in insulation is successful at a blow-in density of 55-60 kg/m3. The heat conductivity;is 0.04 W/mK. Resistance against fire and fungi can be achieved by using additives. Quality control must include settling properties. Blow-in insulation is an industrial standard in many countries and makes about 1.4% of the total insulation volume in Germany.;• Natural fibre re-enforced plastic: specifications include filling grade and mechanical properties.;• Paper: specifications include colour and mechanical properties.;• Combustion pellets: specifications include mechanical stability, levels of ash, nitrogen, and sulphur content and ash melting point. To reduce the ash content, low or medium-quality grass;requires washing.;;b. Grass protein;The value of grass as a ruminant feed is based on its raw protein content. Separation of the protein fraction from the cell wall components opens marketing opportunities for non-ruminants, e.g. pigs and hens. Juice pressed from silage grass has been fed successfully to pigs and piglets. A dried protein product from fresh grass contains around 40% raw protein, 10% raw fat and 15% raw ash, depending on raw material quality and processing conditions. The high methionine content of grass protein makes it particularly suited to laying hens. However, protein extraction and drying are significant cost factors.;;c.Biogas;The water-soluble fraction of good-quality grass yields 200-250 m3 biogas per tonne of dry matter.;Utilisation of biogas includes combustion in a combined heat and power machine, as well as feeding into the natural gas distribution network or gas fuelling stations (after purification and compression).;The grass-refinery process is designed in such a way that it can be optimised according to specific aims (fractionation). This can be the fibre recovery at a specific length distribution profile, or the extraction of proteins, or the optimised recovery of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) for biogas production.;During operation the plant demonstrated the general feasibility of producing technical fibres and biogas (Grass 2004). The technical fibres were further processed on-site for production of a blow-in insulation product. Biogas was utilised in a combined heat and power plant. Heat was used internally for drying fibres. In order to make the entire refinery profitable, it was planned to certify and offer the generated power under the label 'Naturemade Star'.;Production of proteins was planned to be added as a further step. The plant, however, was shut down before the required processes for the generation of proteins were implemented. The reasons for shutting down were manifold32:;• Technical teething trouble: e.g. the capacity of grass scrubber was not sufficient to cope with;unexpected high shares (up to 20%) of polluting materials such as sand and stones. Consequently the scrubber had to be re-sized and replaced. Also, the actual capacity of the drier did not match its specification.;• Unexpected labour costs due to more staff required for packaging of products.;• Changing business environment: Exit of bank investor;• Decreasing engagement of project promoters;In order to account for the fact that the described process produces three products, a multi-output;process is set up.;The plant was designed for a raw material throughput capacity around 0.8 tonnes of dry matter per hour. Literature reports that a yearly input of 4400 tDM of grass (dry matter) was expected. Literature also says that the yield of technical fibres was 500-600 kg per tonne of dry matter and the biogas yield was 150-250 Nm3, depending on raw material quality. Additional production volumes are given in literature.;In the table bellow the yields of the three products as reported in different sources are summarised.;Biogas is digested in a digestion tank. In Schaffhausen, an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor design for biogas production from the water-soluble extracts of grass has been adapted. This reactor design is widely applied in breweries, the sugar industry and various other industries. High-rate anaerobic reactors, such as UASB reactors offer advantages for soluble substrates and larger-scale applications. They also offer scale-up advantages for bio-refinery systems applying solid/liquid separation.;References:;Baier & Delavy 2003. Baier U. and Delavy P. (2003) Bioenergie, Protein & Fasern aus Gras.
