The whole process is fully automatic and consists of five different stages:;;1.	Production of a molten glass piece (gob) with correct weight and temperature. ;;;2.	Forming of the primary shape in a first mould (blank mould) with compressed air pressure;;3.	Transfer to the final mould (finish mould);;4.	Bringing the shaping process to an end by blowing the container with compressed air until the shape of the final mould;;5.	Post forming processes;The melting process is the central one. As the first glass forming material, sand, has a very high melting point. Soda as a fluxing agent is used to reduce the melting temperature. When heating soda, this is decomposed into sodium oxide Na2O, the actual fluxing agent, and into carbon dioxide that is released. Metal oxides in form of limestone (CaCO3 that decomposes to CaO), dolomite (-> Ca- and Mg-Oxides), feldspar are used as stabilizators and therefore to improve the hardness and chemical resistance of glass. For white brown decolouring agents are added.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Minerals",1996-01-01,2023-12-31,Germany,ecoinvent Data Quality System
