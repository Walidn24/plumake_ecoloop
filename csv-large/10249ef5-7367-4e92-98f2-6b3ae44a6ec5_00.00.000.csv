The diluent gas preferably comprises at least one of tetrafluoromethane, hexafluroroethane and hydrogen fluoride, and is preferably rich in hydrogen fluoride. This reaction is also possible with pentafluoroethane, but  tetrafluoroethane is preferable.                                                 The reaction is the following:   CF3CH2F + 2F2  = CF3CF3 + 2HF",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1998-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
