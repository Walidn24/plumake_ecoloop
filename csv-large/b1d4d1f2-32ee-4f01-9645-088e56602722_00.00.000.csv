The magnesium chloride is then separated via the electrolysis process (modelled in a separate activity) and produces magnesium and chlorine. After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the chlorination process as an input.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
