High-purity B2O3 (99 %) is made by fusing refined boric acid ;;2 H3BO3 â†’ B2O3 + 3 H2O;;;;Of the total world borates the United States produces 62 %, Turkey 29 %, and all other sources 9 %, based on B2O3. World borate consumption in the United States is 30 %, Western Europe 37 %, Japan 5 %, and all other countries 28 %. The European and Japanese borate requirements are served through imports largely from the United States and Turkey. Almost all B2O3 production in Turkey and about one-half the production in the United States is exported. ;Baudis, U., Fichte, R.: Boron and Boron Alloys. Published online: 2000.
