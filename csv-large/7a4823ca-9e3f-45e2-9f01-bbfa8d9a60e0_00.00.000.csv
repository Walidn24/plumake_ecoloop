Drying time depends on the initial water content (a function of grain ripeness, grain moisture, air humidity and temperature). The inventories are based on common grain drying plants. Most of the grain-drying plants are equipped with mixed-flow or batch dryers (H채usermann, 2002). The technology of the mixed-flow / batch drying principle is described in Stela (2002) as follows: The product to be dried runs through the dryer from top to bottom due to the force of gravity. Horizontally arranged warm-air and exhaust-air ducts run through vertical product shafts. The optimally designed shape of the roof of these ducts guarantees the even flow of the product. The roof ducts are open downwards at full length. The warm air streams into the column at the front side of the warm air roofs and flows through the closely piled up product. The product warms up, delivers its water into the passing air and dries. As a countermovement, the air cools down and air humidity rises to saturation limit, depending on the product. The humid air escapes through the neighbouring exhaust-air roofs. This air is extracted from the dryer by the exhaust-air fan. The design of the roof ducts guarantees even product moisture and maximum protection of the product.;References;M체ller, H.
