The other one is the hydrothermal process.;;In the furnace process, water glass is produced directly by melting pure silicon sand and soda. Temperatures of approx. 1400 Â°C are required for this process. The sodium silicate produced can then be used directly in a solid form.;;This represents an average technology in Europe.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1995-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
