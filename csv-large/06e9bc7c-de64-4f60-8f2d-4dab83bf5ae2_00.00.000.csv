The other one is the furnace process. ;In the hydrothermal process, sand is dissolved in sodium hydroxide. This process is carried out under high temperature and pressure in an autoclave. After filtration sodium silicate is obtained in a 48% solution. The sodium silicate solution is reacted again with sodium hydroxide. Metasilicate crystallises out and its solid form is mixed to forma an aqueous solution (58%).;This represents an average technology in Europe.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",1995-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
