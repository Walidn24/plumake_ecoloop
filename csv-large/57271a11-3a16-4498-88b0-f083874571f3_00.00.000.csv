The selected technology depends on the geographical and meteorological conditions of the location. Open rack vaporizers (ORV) use seawater to vaporize the LNG. Sodium hypochlorite is added to the seawater inlet stream to avoid algae growth within the heat exchanger tubes. The colder seawater is then, together with the sodium hypochlorite, discharged to the sea. Seawater is only an effective heat source for vaporizing LNG if its temperature is higher 5 Â°C. In submerged combustion vaporizers (SCV), LNG flows in tubes through a water bath, which is heated by burning natural gas. SCVs are mainly used for peak shaving purposes. The technology mix in Europe (assumed the same for all geographies in the database) is calculated based on the shares of technologies used: 60 % open rack vaporizers (ORV) and 40 % submerged combustion vaporizers (Agarwal et al. 2017). Methane emissions from the evaporation are estimated as 3.5E-04 kg methane/m3 (Schori et al. 2012).",00.00.000,Sector: Fuels,2021-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest of Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
