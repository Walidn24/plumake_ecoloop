This inventory refers to 1 kg bleached textile. This dataset only covers all relevant input and output flows for bleaching of 1 kg fabric as a service to the batch dyeing activity.;This activity bleaches greige textile. Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide.;This activity is modeled as a service, so no input of textile is considered. Electricity consumption and chemicals used (hydrogen per oxide, sodium hydroxide, and inorganic chemicals) are considered as inputs. Wastewater discharges as output. A separate dataset is taking care of wasterwater treatment.;Cody, Roxanna (2012). Textile Engineering. First Edition. Delhi.

This activity applies to scoured fabric. As it is a service, no inputs of fabric are included; this activity should be used with 1 kg fabric.
