To generate PU foam, addition of water to the main reagents causes a side reaction producing carbon dioxide, which acts as a blowing agent. Flexible slabstock polyurethane foams are produced as large blocks using a continuous process with minimal human handling. Continuous foam machines are the standard in Europe today.;Reference:;The full report can be accessed here: https://www.europur.org/images/20150821_EPD_EUROPUR_PU_foam.pdf (last accessed 2020-12-14).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1997-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
