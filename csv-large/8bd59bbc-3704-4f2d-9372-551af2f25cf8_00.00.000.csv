It is mainly used in two areas: manufacture of UF6 (18’000- 21’000t/a corresponding to 6’000 – 7’000t of F) and direct manufacture of 5’100 – 7’700t/a of SF6, corresponding to 4’000 – 6’000t of F. The rest is required for miscellaneous applications.;In all modern fluorine-production units, the gas is produced by electrolysis of KF•2HF (solution of potassium fluoride in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride with 40.68 wt % HF).  Potassium salts are used to produce the potassium fluoride.;Elemental fluorine production units are integrated into SF6 and UF6 production units to avoid transport difficulties.;Reference:;Jaccaud M., Faron R., Devilliers D. and Romano R.
