In the coke-making process, coal is heated in an oxygen-depleted environment to remove volatile components and produce coke. Wet quenching is employed to rapidly cool down the hot coke and stabilize its structure. The coke is typically transferred to a quenching tower, where it comes into contact with water sprays or is submerged in water. This immediate cooling prevents the coke from further reacting with oxygen, which could result in its combustion. Additionally, wet quenching helps to harden and strengthen the coke, making it more suitable for transportation and handling.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat; Fuels,2013-01-01,2024-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
