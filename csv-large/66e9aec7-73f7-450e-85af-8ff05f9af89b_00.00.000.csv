The fatty alcohols can be derived from petrochemical, palm kernel, or coconut oil. The reaction takes place at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 200°C. The grade of ethoxylation, e.g. the specific number of polyether units condensed to the alcohol chains, is controlled by the concentration of ethylene oxide in the ethoxylation process. ;This is an average technology for the production of AE representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s.;Reference:;Schul W.
