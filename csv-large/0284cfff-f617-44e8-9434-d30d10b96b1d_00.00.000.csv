Hydrogen and chlorine are withdrawn from the cell. The rest of the reaction mixture contains KOH, water, and unreacted potassium chloride. This reaction mixture is then concentrated in an evaporator. Most of the potassium chloride crystallizes by evaporation, and is recycled. After evaporation, the potassium hydroxide is precipitated. Potassium hydroxide, chlorine and hydrogen are obtained from potassium chloride brine according to the following reaction:;2 KCl + 2 H2O -> 2 KOH + Cl2 + H2;Reference:;Jungbluth, N., Chudacoff, M., Dauriat, A., Dinkel, F., Doka, G., Faist Emmenegger, M., Gnansounou, E., Kljun, N., Schleiss, K., Spielmann, M., Stettler, C., Sutter, J. 2007: Life Cycle Inventories of Bioenergy. ecoinvent report No. 17, Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, DÃ¼bendorf, CH.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1998-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
