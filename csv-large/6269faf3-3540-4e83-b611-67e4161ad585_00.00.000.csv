The transportation processes are average for transportation to Europe; transport distance however can vary. Site-specific debarking data are not available but takes place before shipping the logs to Europe, thus European data are used. The resulting bark is left to rot, which is not inventoried.;According to Collins et al. (2005), there is no consumption of diesel fuel and lubricating oil. ;References:;Collins, M., K.
