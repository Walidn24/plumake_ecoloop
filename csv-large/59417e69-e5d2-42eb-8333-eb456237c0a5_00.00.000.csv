The presence of iron in ilmenite leads to the cogeneration of iron sulfate. The sulfate process consists of the following sequential stages ;1. raw material import and preparation. The ore is stored in covered silos to avoid drying in case it becomes wet. It is then ground using large ball mills to produce particles typically 40-60 um for efficient dissolution with concentrated sulfuric acid. The main emissions at this stage are dust. This is collected by discharging the gas through bag filters. ;2. Digestion: reporting by EU producers indicates operation in batches is commonly used. The ilmenite is mixed with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (80-95%) and this is necessary to digest the feedstock containing TiO2. A highly exothermic reaction is initated by the addition of a measured quantity of steam at around 140°C.  The equation is summarized as: FeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 = TiOSO4 + 2H2O + FeSO4   The off-gases contain small quantities of dust, sulfur dioxide and acid fumes, which are removed by scrubbing. The resulting solid cake is dissolved in water and acid recycled from subsequent washing step. The primary intermediate from the reaction is titanyl suphate (TiOSO4),;3. Reduction: the digester liquor is contacted with scrap iron. This process generates a small amount of H2, which is returned to the air.;4. Clarification and crystallization: titanyl sufate is recovered from the solution and neutralised with lime before going to landfill. This material can be also used as inert filler. The clarified solution is pumped to bacth cooler/crystalisers to remove the bulk of the iron sulfate as the solid heptahydrate 'copperas'. This is widely used in water treatment and other industries. The iron-depleted product liquor is concentrated in evaporators.;5. Hydrolysis (hydrate precipitation). The reaction is:;TiOSO4 + 2H2O = TiO(OH)2 + H2SO4 ;Precipitation of the hydrated TiO2 is achieved by boiling the liquor for some hours followed by cooling to 60°C. At this stage of the process, the spenc acid with a concentration of 20-25% H2SO4 and 10-15% soluble salts (mainly iron, aluminium and mangesium sulfates) arises and is either recycled or neutralised with lime to produce gypsum which is preferntially sold at local markets as a commercial product.;6. Calcination: The rotary kilns are directly fired with oil or gas. Scrubbing calciner gas treatment has been upgraded in the past in order to reduce SO2 emissions. SO2 is normally reduced to form sulfuric acid and then recycled in the process. ;7. Finishing. The resulting solid is cooled, milled, coated, washed, dried and micronised.;References:;European Commission (2007) Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for the Manufacture of Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals - Solids and Others industry.
