Concentrated sulfuric acid (ca. 5 %) is used as a catalyst. Operating conditions vary; temperatures  range from 130 to 200 °C and pressures range from a slight pressure to a partial vacuum (25 –110 kPa). A favorable temperature  is reported to be 160 °C. The process is continuous, with 1,4-dioxane vaporized from the reaction vessel. The vapors are passed  through an acid trap and two distillation columns to remove water and to purify the product. Yields of ca. 90 % are possible.  2-Methyl-1,3-dioxolane, acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and polyglycol are unwanted byproducts.;References:;Surprenant, K.: Dioxane.
