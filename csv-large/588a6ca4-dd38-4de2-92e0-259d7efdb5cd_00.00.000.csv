Ultimate average landfill height is 7 meters. Operation phase duration is 15 years. The total, waste-specific raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill is 0.07115 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.03713 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 100w%. A Methane Correction Factor (MCF) for landfill air emissions of 0.7057 is employed. Leachate of the landfill is not treated, but emitted untreated. Based on average waste composition and chosen climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 1'603 years after waste deposition.
