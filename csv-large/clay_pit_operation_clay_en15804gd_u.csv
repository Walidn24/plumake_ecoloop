The average amount is about 25'000m3. For the production of clay products in total about 1.4 Mio m3 raw material (loose volume) has been mined in the year 1991. The guaranteed amount of reserves of raw material (consolidated volume) in Switzerland is about 35 Mio. m3. This meets the Swiss demand for the next 35 to 40 years. It is assumed that about 70 Mio. m3 of raw material near the existing mines is an additionally available but not guaranteed reserve. In addition Switzerland has a huge potential on raw material specially molasse marl and opalinus clay. For other raw materials as for example loess clay the reserves are very small. ;;The Swiss Geotechnical Commission made the following general comment on resources of primary materials in Switzerland .;The resources used from the non-metallic minerals industry can be regarded as quarryable when their mining is possible with actual technology, the usage realisable with supportable financial and temporal expenditure and if the utilisation does not collide with other interests. This last point causes a lot of problems in Switzerland as in the intensely populated landscape (Middle Lands) all different kind of utilizations collide. These are for example water protection, set-tlement area etc. This circumstance reduces the real quarryable area fundamentally.;References:;Kündig R., Mumenthaler T., Eckardt P., Keusen H.
