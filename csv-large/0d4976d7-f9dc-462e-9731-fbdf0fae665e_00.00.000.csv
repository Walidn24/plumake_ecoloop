A finely divided stream of oxygen is reacted with phosphorus trichloride until the freezing point of the product is 1 °C. The reaction is accelerated by carrying it out under pressure. The presence of orthophosphoric acid has a catalytic effect, but traces of metallic impurities such as copper and cobalt, or of sulfur compounds, decrease the reaction rate. In a Hoechst process, phosphorus trichloride and oxygen are passed in cocurrent through a stainless steel water-cooled packed column. The oxidation process, i.e., the uptake of oxygen, can be followed by the characteristic temperature changes. The first product, which leaves the column at a maximum temperature of 35 °C, has a freezing point of ca. 0.9 °C, and is taken from the top of the column into a second column where it is again treated with oxygen. This procedure avoids large temperature increases. The excess oxygen leaving the plant passes through a cold trap where entrained phosphoryl chloride is condensed out and recovered. The off-gas is then scrubbed with water. Commercial phosphoryl chloride contains ca. 99.5 % POCl3 and traces of phosphorus trichloride.;Bettermann, G., Krause, W., Riess, G., Hofmann, T.: Phosphorus Compounds, Inorganic Published online: 2000.
