Another drawback is the limited lifetime of the catalyst, which is a multicomponent system composed of polyvalent oxides with molybdenum oxide as main component and tellurium oxide as promotor. The disadvantages of this process lead to the development of the two-step process.;CH2=CHCH3 (propylene) + 3/2 O2 → CH2=CHCO2H (acrylic acid) + H2O;- Two-step propylene oxidation: The limited life of the catalyst has promoted a two stage manufacturing process via acrolein using two catalysts. The first stage is the oxidation of propylene to acrolein using a bismuth molybdate catalyst in a strongly exothermic reaction (at about 370°C). In the second stage, the acrolein gas is passed over a molybdenum vanadium oxide catalyst that is also exothermic (at about 270°C - about 100°C cooler than the first stage). The crude acrylic acid is then cooled to about 80°C, absorbed in water (30 to 60% concentration) and extracted with organic solvent or water (depending on the concentration).;CH2=CHCH3 (propylene) + O2 → CH2=CHCHO (acrolein) + H2O;CH2=CHCHO + 1/2 O2 → CH2=CHCO2H (acrylic acid);In a subsequent step, acrylic acid is separated from the large volume of water present in the absorber effluent. This purification runs either by distillation from the solvent or by removing from water with added inhibitors to minimise the formation of polymers. Conversion rates of almost 100% conversion for acrolein and yields of acrylic acid greater than 90 % are achievable at commercial scales of production depending on technology, catalysts and conditions.;The inventory in this dataset models the production of acrylic acid from propylene by the two-step oxidation process, based on the amount of output products obtained from the literature and the consideration of the complete scheme of competing reactions. Namely, an overall yield of 95% was assumed for the reaction scheme that produces acrylic acid based on the two stage process. At the same time, a yield of 95% was assumed for any additional side reaction that produces acetic acid as byproduct.;References:;Ohara, T., Sato, T., Shimizu, N., Prescher, G., Schwind, H., Weiberg, O., Marten, K. and Greim, H. 2011.
