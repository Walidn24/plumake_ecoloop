The solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is used to prepare the cathode slurry. The input materials are mixed to form a slurry, then the mixture is dried with the solvent evaporating away, cut and calendered to form the cathode of a Li-ion battery. The energy required to coat the aluminium conductor foil with the cathode slurry is included in this dataset, because it was not possible to separate it from the energy required for the drying step.
