For technical details of the different installation components see in the particular infrastructure datasets. The construction process of integrated slanted-roof installations is the following way: The roof tiles are removed in the area foreseen for the solar laminates. Then steel profiles are screwed to the tile slats. Different aluminium profiles are used to make a frame for the laminate. A rubber is attached to these profiles. The laminates are placed within these frames and connected to the electric system. All edges are closed with rubber or silicones. Steel sheets are mounted at the gp between roof tiles and solar laminates.
