Thionyl chloride is, at present, generally produced by treating SO2 or SO3 with SCl2 at ca. 150 – 250 °C in the presence of activated carbon.;Reaction:;SCl2 + SO2 + Cl2 → 2 SOCl2;The crude product is purified by distillation after addition of sulfur. Crude thionyl chloride production is a continuous process, but the distillation is carried out either continuously or in batches. ;Furthermore, the SO2 reactant can also react with chlorine to give SO2Cl2, as follows ;Reaction:;SO2 + Cl2 → SO2Cl2;Therefore, the unreacted SO2 and the SO2Cl2 byproduct could be recycled, and further converted to SOCl2.;Reaction:;SCl2 + SO2Cl2 → 2 SOCl2;In this dataset, for each reaction step, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
