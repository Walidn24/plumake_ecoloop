To generate PU foam, addition of water to the main reagents causes a side reaction producing carbon dioxide, which acts as a blowing agent. Flexible slabstock polyurethane foams are produced as large blocks using a continuous process with minimal human handling. Continuous foam machines are the standard in Europe today.;The process represents production with water as a blowing agent, althought this might not be the case all over the world. If this is important in your study, make sure to check which blowing agent is used and replace it, if necessary.;References:;The full report can be accessed here: https://www.europur.org/images/20150821_EPD_EUROPUR_PU_foam.pdf (last accessed 2020-12-14).;The data is a copy of the corresponding RER dataset, uncertianty has been adjusted accrodingly.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,1997-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
