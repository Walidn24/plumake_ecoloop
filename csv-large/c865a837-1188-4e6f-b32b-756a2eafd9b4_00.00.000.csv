In both cases, first there is a mining and crushing step and then there is a calcination step with a temperature of about 800 - 1000 °C, for which rotary kilns or hearth furncaces techniques are used.;Due to missing production data and no quantitative information in Seeger et al. (2000), process data from similar processes within the ecoinvent project are used as a first approximation for the caustic magnesium oxide production:;- Mining: the data for the mining operation are taken from iron mining (Classen et al. 2007). As resource “magnesite, in ground” with a yield of 90% (assumption due to lack of respective information) is used while all other inputs and outputs are taken 1:1 from iron mining. Due to a lack of data, a magnesite content in the crude ore of 60% is assumed here.;- Crushing: The data from limestone crushing are used as a first approximation. Therefore, the data are taken from the dataset “primary crushing of limestone” in Kellenberger et al. (2007).;- Benefication: No process specific information are available - therefore the input and output data from the iron benefication process of the ecoinvent project (shown in Classen et al. 2007) are used as a first approximation. This process has a yield of 85% - a value that, due to a lack of more specific data for magnesium oxide, is used here as well.;- Caustic magnesium oxide production: The data from lime calcination are used as a first approximation due to the fact that this process uses also a kiln. This process has a yield of 58% - a value that, due to a lack of more specific data, is used here as well.;References:;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Doka G., Jungbluth N. and Tuchschmid M.
