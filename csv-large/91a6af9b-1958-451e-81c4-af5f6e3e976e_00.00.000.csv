This activity represents the construction and deconstruction of a heat and power cogeneration unit working on an Organic Rankine Cycle with a capacity of 1MWel and 6.4 MWth. The dataset was created for modelling power production in a deep geothermal power plant. ;Detailed information on this dataset is presented in the book 'Energy from the Earth. 2015. Hirschberg, Wiemer, Burgherr (eds.) (see field 'Data Generator and Publication').

Starting from the materials and land available for the construction of the building and the machines

Ends with decommissioning of the plant. ",00.00.000,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat; Electricity,2016-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
