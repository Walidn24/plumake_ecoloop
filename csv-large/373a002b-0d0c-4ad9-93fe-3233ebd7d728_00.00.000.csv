This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the global market for  '""cathode, LFP, for Li-ion battery"".;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;LFP batteries are mainly produced in China and used in the domestic public transport. For instance, in 2018, companies like CATL and BYD together sold 78% of electric bus lithium-ion batteries in China; both of which favour LFP batteries.
