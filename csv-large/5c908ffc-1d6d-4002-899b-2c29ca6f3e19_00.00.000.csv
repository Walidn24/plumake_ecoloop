Many chlorosilanes react with ammonia to give not stable, simple silylamines SiNH2, but disubstitution products with the SiNHSi building block. The exothermic reaction can be carried out in solvents such as hexane, toluene, or isododecane, but is best performed in warm HMDS itself. The latter variant leads to the formation of coarse-grained ammonium chloride, which can be readily stirred and filtered and gives better turnover and yield. The suggestion has been made that the salt be separated by treatment with water. ;A continuous process for the production of HMDS consisting of the concurrent actions of continuously introducing predetermined quantities per time unit of trimethylchlorosilane and gaseous ammonia to form a mixture of HMDS and ammonium chloride in a first reactor while simultaneously subjecting said mixture to continuous high shear agitation, for a time period related to the volume of the reactor and the quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia introduced, to form a slurry; and simultaneously separating the ammonium chloride from said slurry to provide a solution principally comprising HMDS, while continuing to introduce a continuous flow of further quantities of trimethylchlorosilane and ammonia as the HMDS is removed. ;;RÃ¶sch, L., John, P., Reitmeier, R.: Silicon Compounds, Organic.
