Rarely also basalt, grey wacke or gravel but no chemical additives are used. There is no information about the usage of additional additives. For colouring of the bricks, especially for fair faced bricks and facings, iron and chromium oxide pigments are common.;The production process is divided in the five following steps:;1.	Limestone and sand from local mines are stored in the company’s silos. The raw materials are mixed in a share of one part limestone and twelve parts sand. The raw mixture is transported by conveyor belt into a reaction vessel.;2.	Inside the reaction vessel the quick lime is slaked to hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2). This process takes usually about 4 hours. If necessary, a pre-mixer adds water to the mixture to bring it up to pressing humidity.;3.	By full automatic working presses the raw moulded blanks are formed with a pressure of usually 15 N/mm2 (maximum 25 N/mm2). The raw moulded blanks are then stored on a hardening wagon.;4.	The hardening of the raw moulded blanks takes place in the pressure vessel with a saturated steam at a pressure of 12 to 16 bar, a temperature of 160 to 200°C, and for a time period of 4 to 8 hours. The previous values are depending on the amounts of the components and the strength to be reached. At the hardening process the hot steam etches silicic acid on the surface of the sand granules. The silicic acid compounds form together with the adhesive hydrated lime crystalline material which epitaxy on the sand granules and stick them together in a solid way.;5.	After hardening and cooling down, the sand-lime bricks are ready for use.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Cement & Concrete; Minerals",1993-01-01,2023-12-31,Germany,ecoinvent Data Quality System
