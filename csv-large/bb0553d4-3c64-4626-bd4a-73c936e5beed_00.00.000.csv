Incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste and it includes fly ash extraction (FAE). Auxiliary material consumption for this step of air pollution control (APC) are included in the process. Air polution control includes electrostatic precipitator for fly ash (ESP), wet flue gas scrubber and 25%  SNCR , 42.77%  SCR-high dust , 32.68%  SCR-low dust -DeNOx facilities and 0% without DeNOx  (weighted according to mass of burnt waste). Efficiency of iron scrap separation from slag : 58%. Efficiency of aluminium scrap separation from slag : 31%. Efficiency of copper scrap separation from slag : 31%. The technology mix for this dataset includes a filter ash treatment (FLUWA) of a share of 46.22%. Gross electric efficiency technology mix 15.84% and Gross thermal efficiency technology mix 28.51% ",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,2006-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
