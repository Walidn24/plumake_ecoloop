This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'water, deionised', in the geography of Switzerland.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;water, deionised'  is an inorganic substance with the CAS no. : 007732-18-5. It is called 'dihydrogen oxide' under IUPAC naming. It is characterised by being free of most mineral ions (such as iron, sodium, calcium, copper, sulphate, chloride among others). Its molecular formula is: H2O. It is liquid under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: cooling systems, machines lubrication, cosmetic and pharmaceutical, medicine production and food processing.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'water, deionised',  within the geography of Switzerland.

This activity ends with the supply of  water, deionised', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Water Supply,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
