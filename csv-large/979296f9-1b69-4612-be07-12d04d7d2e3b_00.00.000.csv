The production is essentially carried out in a batch system.;CH3CH2OH + CS2 + NaOH --> CH3CH2OCS2Na + H2O;The process is usually carried out in two steps:;1. CH3CH2OH + NaOH --> CH3CH2ONa + H2O;Excess of precooled alcohol is added to the reactor and sodium hydroxide is added slowly. Since the reaction is exothermic, is has to be cooled continously by cooling water.;2. CH3CH2ONa + CS2 --> CH2CH2OCS2Na;Carbon disulfide is added under continued refrigeration.;Emissions from the xanthate plant are reported to be negligible as neither the solid nor the liquid plants generate solid or liquid effluents. All non-product outputs are returned to the process for conversion to xanthate.;Reference:;Kunene, M. C.
