An aqueous solution of sodium chloroacetate is then added slowly with stirring; the temperature must not exceed 90 °C. Stirring is maintained at this temperature for an hour. Particular care must be taken to ensure that the hydrogen cyanide, which is formed continuously in small amounts, is trapped and neutralized. The solution of sodium cyanoacetate is concentrated by evaporation under vacuum and then transferred to a glass-lined reaction vessel for hydrolysis of the cyano group and esterification. The alcohol and mineral acid (weight ratio 1:2 to 1:3) are introduced in such a manner that the temperature does not rise above 60 – 80 °C. For each mol of ester, ca. 1.2 mol of alcohol is added. Hydrochloric acid, which is formed as byproduct from unreacted chloroacetic acid, is fed into an absorption column. After the addition of acid and alcohol is complete, the mixture is heated at reflux for 6 – 8 h, whereby the intermediate malonic acid ester monoamide is hydrolyzed to a dialkyl malonate. The pure ester is obtained from the mixture of crude esters by extraction with benzene, toluene, or xylene. The organic phase is washed with dilute sodium hydroxide to remove small amounts of the monoester. The diester is then separated from solvent by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the malonic ester obtained by distillation under vacuum as a colourless liquid with a minimum assay of 99 % (gas chromatography). The aqueous phase contains considerable amounts of mineral acid and salts and must be treated before being fed to the waste treatment plant. The process is suitable for both the dimethyl and diethyl esters.;Although a relatively simple plant is sufficient for the reaction itself, a sizeable investment is required for treatment of the wastewater and exhaust gas.;The yield based on sodium chloroacetate is 75 – 85 %. Various low molecular mass hydrocarbons, some of them partially chlorinated, are formed as byproducts. In this dataset, an overal yield of 85% was assumed (i.e., an average 92% yield for each reaction step). ;References:;Frischknecht R., Jungbluth N., Althaus H.-J., Doka G., Dones R., Heck T., Hellweg S., Hischier R., Nemecek T., Rebitzer G. and Spielmann M.
