In this region, maize can be produced as a monoculture or in cropping systems, including other crops such as beans. When in a cropping system, land occupation, liming operation and limestone are allocated among the products of the system, adopting factors that consider the fraction of area and the occupation time. The average productivity is 6600 kg/ha, at 14% moisture.;Agricultural operation was modelled based on the total diesel consumed to perform the operation and the emissions to air related to diesel burning.;There was no net expansion of maize in these states for the period 1999-2020, according to IBGE data.
