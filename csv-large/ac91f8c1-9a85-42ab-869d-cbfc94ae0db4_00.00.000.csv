Then, a two-step beneficiation process is applied to produce the REO concentrate. In the first step, ball milling and magnetic separation is used for the isolation of the iron ore. In the second step, the resullting REO tailing (containing monazite and bastnasite), is processed to get a 70% REO equivalent concentrate via flotation. As explained in the general comment, the production pathway is the same as in the Bayan Obo mine (see rare earth element mine operation and beneficiation, CN-NM dataset).",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,"China, Sichuan (四川)",ecoinvent Data Quality System
