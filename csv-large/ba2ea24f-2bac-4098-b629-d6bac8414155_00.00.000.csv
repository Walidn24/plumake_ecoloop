This dataset represents the production of 1 m2 of horticultural fleece typically used in horticulture but also for crop protection against frost. Features of the model: the fleece density is 17g/m2 and lasts for an average of 5 years (information provided by J. Krauss, Agroscope). The fleece is made from polypropylene (PP) and produced in an extrusion process. This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters.

The activity starts with the production of the flees.

The module includes manufacture and processing of the raw material. Infrastructure is not included.",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
