This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for flattened bamboo. Transport according to the ecoinvent Default Transport Assumptions for global transport, accessible at https://www.ecoinvent.org/files/transport_default_20191112.xlsx, based on transport statistics, according to a methodology developed by Borken & Weidema (2013) .;Flattened bamboo is produced in a handcrafted process. The main application of flattened bamboo is in load-bearing wall systems, where it is used between bamboo poles to support the soil-cement mortar with which the walls are plastered (Murphy et al., 2004; Zea Escamilla et al., 2013). Flattened bamboo is also used to produce woven bamboo mats. ;

This dataset starts with flattened bamboo leaving the gate of the producing entity, ready for distribution to consuming entities.

The activity ends with the flattened bamboo being delivered to the consuming entity",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
