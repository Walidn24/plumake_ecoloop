This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'vinyl chloride', in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;vinyl chloride', is a plastic product of fossil origin. It is a precursor substance meant to be used for the further production of plastics. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure and mostly odourless (50%),Â biting (25%) or it has other odour (25%). The product is used in the following applications and sectors: Vinyl chloride is an important commercial chemical and Its major use is in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other copolymer plastics. Other industrial uses include intermediates, laboratory chemicals, wire and cable manufacture, while for consumer uses, i can be used as building/construction materials, petrochemical manufacturing, plastic and rubber products.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'vinyl chloride',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  vinyl chloride', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
