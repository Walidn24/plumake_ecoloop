Frequently found in groundwater, along with their transformation products. Triazines are produced by amination of cyanuric acid.; ;The dataset triazine-compounds was calculated from the arithmetic mean of all inputs and outputs of the production of atrazine, metamitron, simazin, and terbuthylazine.;;Atrazine is produced in four steps from hydrogen cyanide:;HCN + Cl2 → ClCN + HCl;3 ClCN → C3Cl3N3;C3Cl3N3 + C2H7N → C5H6Cl2N4 + HCl;C5H6Cl2N4 + C3H9N → C8H14ClN5 + HCl;Precursors that are used for the atrazine production are ethylamine (C2H7N) and isopropylamine (C3H9N).;;Metamitron is produced in eight steps from toluene:;C7H8 + 3 Cl2 → C7H5Cl3 + 3 HCl;C7H5Cl3 + H2O → C7H5ClO + 2 HCl;C7H5ClO + NaCN → C8H5NO + NaCl;C8H5NO + 2 H2O → C8H6O3 + NH3;C8H6O3 + CH4O → C9H8O3 + H2O;C9H8O3 + C2H6N2O → C11H12N2O3 + H2O;C11H12N2O3 + N2H4 → C10H12N4O2 + CH4O;C10H12N4O2 → C10H10N4O + H2O;Precursors that are used for the metamitron production are acetyl hydrazine (C2H6N2O) and hydrazine (N2H4).;;Simazine is produced in three steps from hydrogen cyanide:;HCN + Cl2 → ClCN + HCl;3 ClCN → C3Cl3N3;C3Cl3N3 + C2H7N → C7H12ClN5 + HCl;A precursor that is used for the simazine production is ethylamine (C2H7N).;;Terbuthylazine is produced in four steps from hydrogen cyanide:;HCN + Cl2 → ClCN + HCl;3 ClCN → C3Cl3N3;C3Cl3N3 + C2H7N → C5H6Cl2N4 + HCl;C5H6Cl2N4 + C4H11N → C9H16ClN5 + HCl;Precursors that are used for the terbuthylazine production are tert-butyl amine (C4H11N) and ethylamine (C2H7N).;;Precursors:;;Acetyl hydrazine (C2H6N2O) is produced from methyl acetate and hydrazine:;N2H4 + C3H6O2 → C2H6N2O + CH4O;;Ethylamine (C2H7N) is produced from ethanol and ammonia:;C2H6O + NH3 → C2H7N + H2O;;Hydrazine (C2H3N3) is produced in two steps from sodium hypochlorite:;NaOCl + NH3 → NH2Cl + NaOH;NH2Cl + NaOH + NH3 → N2H4 + NaCl + H2O;;Isopropylamine (C3H9N) is produced from isopropanol and ammonia:;C3H8O + NH3 → C3H9N + H2O;;tert-Butyl amine (C4H11N) is produced in two steps from 2-methylpropene:;C4H8 + H2O + HCN + H2SO4 → C5H11NO + H2SO4;C5H11NO + H2O + H2SO4 + 3 NaOH → C4H11N + NaCHO2 + Na2SO4 + 3 H2O",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
