This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'hard coal', in the Global geography.;Average global transport distances have been used. Dust from transport and load/unload operations is included. Average coal losses are considered. Average emissions to water due to leaching from coal heaps at storage is estimated from the literature.;hard coal' is a fossil fuel with a calorific value of 27.91 MJ/kg. It is used as a solid fuel and is sourced from coal mines after crushing, screening and washing the coal. Its main applications are in the following sectors: domestic fuel (mainly for hand-fired stoves), as filter media and as an ingredient in charcoal briquettes.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'hard coal',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'hard coal',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Fuels",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
