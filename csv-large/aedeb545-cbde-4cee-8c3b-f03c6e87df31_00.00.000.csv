This dataset represents the interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP (Net Primary Productivity of a given land, in kg C / m2 and year) by land that is already in use as arable land. NPP values are parameterized and reported by Haberl et al. (2007)

Starts with the land already in use.

The dataset includes all interventions associated with the provision of 1 kg NPP0 from land already in use.
