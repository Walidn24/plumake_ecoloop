Digestion is performed with NaOH solution. A rough sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) solu-tion is obtained via filtration. After dilution of the Na2WO4 solution with water, ion exchange tech-nology is used to convert Na2WO4 to ammonium tungstate ((NH4)2WO4) and to remove impurities such as sodium, arsenic, silicon, vanadium and phosphorus. Tungsten is first adsorbed to the ion exchange resin and afterwards desorption takes place by washing the resin with ammonium chloride solution, ammonium hydroxide and deionized water. Subsequently, ammonium sulfide and a copper compound are used to remove molybdenum and other impurities. (Shen et al. 2019). APT production via the solid ion exchange technology causes the production of large amount of waste water with high salinity (Shen et al. 2019).;;Shen, L., Li, X., Lindberg, D., Taskinen, P., 2019.
