This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'heat and power co-generation unit, 6400kW thermal, building', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, building, with a thermal output of 6,400kW.  The infrastructure has a lifetime of 20 years, operation time for heat production of 2,030 h/year and for electricity production 3,500 h/year. The floor area of the power plant buildings is assumed to be 2000 m2. The process includes the most important materials used for the construction of the building, land use and the decommission of the building.

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat; Electricity",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
