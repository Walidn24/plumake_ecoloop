Abatement of N2O emissions is assumed to reduce the emissions by 95% through regenerative thermal oxidation.;Essentially all production of adipic acid is derived from the nitric acid oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone – cyclohexanol (KA mixture). The reactor, controlled at 60 – 80 °C and 0.1 – 0.4 MPa, is charged with the recycled nitric acid stream, the KA feed material, and makeup acid containing 50 – 60 % nitric acid and copper – vanadium catalyst. The reaction is very exothermic (6.280 MJ/kg). Adipic acid is obtained with a yield greater than 90%. Nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and some lower dicarboxylic acids are the major by-products, as well as oxidation products arising from impurities in the KA intermediate. Succinic and glutaric acid are accounted for as by-products in this dataset (5.7%).;The nitric acid oxidation step produces three major waste streams: an off-gas containing oxides of nitrogen and CO2, water containing traces of nitric acid and organics from the water removal column; and a dibasic acid purge stream containing adipic, glutaric and succinic acids. The production of adipic acid can be represented by the following simplified reaction formula:;0.733 C6H12O + 0.367 C6H10O + 2 HNO3 -> C6H10O4 + N2O + 2 H2O + 7.23 H2;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
