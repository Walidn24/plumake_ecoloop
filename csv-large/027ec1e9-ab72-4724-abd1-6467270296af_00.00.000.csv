This represents the share of basic oxygen furnace sludge that is recovered for use via internal (in iron and steelmaking) or external routes (e.g. cement making).Through this renaming, the by-product classification of the basic oxygen furnace sludge is changed from 'waste' to 'recyclable material'.

Activity starts with the reception of 'basic oxygen furnace sludge'.
