Sinter is used in BF to avoid use of raw flux in furnace, lower thermal load, increase the productivity and reduce coke rate. The best advantage of sinter is that it is self fluxed.  ;;More information can be found in MECON report on sinter - http://www.meconlimited.co.in/writereaddata/MIST_2016/sesn/tech_2/6.pdf;Image Source: http://ispatguru.com/understanding-sinter-and-sinter-plant-operations/;",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2007-01-01,2023-12-31,India,ecoinvent Data Quality System
