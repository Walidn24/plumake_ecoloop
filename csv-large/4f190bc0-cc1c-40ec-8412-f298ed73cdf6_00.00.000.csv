Rotating sieving cylinders dip in this fibre cement mush which drain to the inside. Therefore the sieve surface gets covered with a layer of fleece of about 1mm which is transported with a conveyor belt. The produced endless mat is winded up on a format-cylinder until the demanded thickness is reached. With that process the fibres of the neighbour layers are interconnecting. After cutting up the mat cylinder the mat is detached from the format-cylinder and by punching and pressing automatically formed to small format slates, even and corrugated slabs.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Cement & Concrete",1991-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
