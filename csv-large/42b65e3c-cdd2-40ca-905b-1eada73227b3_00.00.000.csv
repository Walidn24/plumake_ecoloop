This data represents the service of collecting sawdust, expressed per kg dry mass and transporting it to its silo via aspiration.;The process chain in a sawmill is a net of interlinked processes; the process structure depends on the individual design and technologies in place for each sawmill. The structuring of the sawmilling processes is based on the identification of the core processes in a sawmill that are attributable to several co-products (such as upstream processes like forestry and transport of logs to the sawmill) sorting, storing and the sawing of the (debarked) log. Other processes are attributable directly to one of the co-products such as the chipping of residual wood (either after sawing or as part of the profile chipping), the chipping of the bark (the ""debarking"") or the suction of saw dust as collection and internal transport.;The following figure illustrates the general structure of the sawmilling processes before eventual drying and planing:;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry (Holzindustrie Schweiz HIS).

The activity starts with the sawdust at the sawing machine.

This activity ends with the sawdust collected at a silo at the sawmill site. The dataset does not include direct wood dust emissions nor specific infrastructure, which is taken into account as a rough estimate in the sawmilling process.",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
