It involves the endothermic dehydrogenation of 1,4-butanediol in the gas phase. This process is used by BASF, ISP, and Lyondell.;Preheated 1,4-butanediol vapor is introduced into a hot stream of circulating hydrogen and passed at atmospheric pressure through a bed of copper catalyst at temperatures between 180 and 240°C. The yield of butyrolactone is approximately 95 %. The reaction takes place via γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde.;The byproduct hydrogen off-gas requires only simple purification before reuse (e.g., catalytic methanization of carbon monoxide impurities). The crude butyrolactone separated from the recycle gas stream contains small amounts of byproducts, including 1,4-butanediol, butyric acid, and high boilers, from which butyrolactone is separated by distillation.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
