This dataset describes the production of a controller suitable for the power electronics of an electric scooter. It comprises the various electronic components making out the logic control unit and the power transistors (IGBTs). The entries are given on a function of kg of device. The original data was collected for a device of approximately 1.3 kg weight. The dataset is based on direct inspection of existing commercial devices of current technology.

The datasets takes as input the various electronic components required to build the controller and includes the components' production efforts. Assembly energy not included due to lack of data.

The dataset returns the assembled device and production waste as a by-product.",00.00.000,Sector: Electronics,2005-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
