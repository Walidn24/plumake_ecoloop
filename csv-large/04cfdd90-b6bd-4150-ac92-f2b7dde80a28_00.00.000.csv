This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'laser machining, metal, with YAG-laser, 50W power', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is delivering the service of 'laser machining, metal, with YAG-laser, 50W power'. Laser machining is used to cut, drill, weld or engrave metals. This type of laser is YAG  laser, a solid state laser, that operates in pulsed or in a continuous laser beam, with a power of 50W. The service represents the operation of a YAG laser, used in a semi-automatic machine processing 2D or 3D pieces, in 100% power for 1 hour.  It  does not include the input of the material processed, nor infrastructure. Thus, they have to be added separately. Laser cutting is primarily used on sheets of metals, or cutting of non-flat objects while it can also weld aluminium, titanium, carbon steel and stainless steel.

This activity starts with the service generation.


This activity ends with the service supplied to its consumers. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Metals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
