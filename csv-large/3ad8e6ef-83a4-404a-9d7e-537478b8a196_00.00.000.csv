Mining is done 70% open pit and 30% underground, followed by joint beneficiation of copper and molybdenite trough flotation, where considerable amounts of agents are added. Overburden is disposed separate to sulfidic tailings near the mining site. No dewatering (or other pre-treatment) of the tailings of is assumed as this is considered a treatment activity that occurs only at selective sites and is therefore modelled separately.",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals,1994-01-01,2023-12-31,Canada,ecoinvent Data Quality System
