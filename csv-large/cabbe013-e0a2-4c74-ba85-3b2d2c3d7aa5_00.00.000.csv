Silo average capacity is 240 tonnes.;This technology is used when grains can be harvest at low moisture content (e.g. about 18%), hence avoiding the need of hot air drying. Ambiant air drying in silo lasts 15 days. Afterwards, grains are stored in a ventilated silo for 4 days. Dust and particulate emission to air are not considered.  ;References : ;BEAUREGARD, G.
