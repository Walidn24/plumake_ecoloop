The alloy Sicromal, containing 25 % Cr, 20 % Ni, and 2 % Si, is particularly suitable. Triethyl phosphate is employed as the catalyst.;CH3COOH → CH2CO + H2O, ΔH = 147 MJ;CH3COOH + CH2CO → (CH3CO)2O, ΔH = -63 MJ;Hot acetic acid vapor is broken into ketene and water at 700 – 750 °C in the presence of traces of phosphoric acid catalyst. The pressure in the reactor is generally reduced so that the ketene can be isolated before it reacts with acetic acid or with water. The cleavage takes place in a multicoil reactor with coils made of highly heat-resistant steel alloys. Triethyl phosphate is employed as the catalyst.;The above figure shows how the vacuum process operates. Acetic acid is fed continuously into the evaporator (a). The acetic acid vapor leaving the evaporator passes over the catalyst evaporator (b), which is supplied continuously with catalyst, and thence into the ketene oven (c). The acetic acid is heated (d) and then cleaved (e). As soon as the cracked gases have left the oven, ammonia is added to prevent the ketene from reacting with the water or with the remaining acetic acid. For the same reason, and also to remove condensable gases, the hot gas is cooled in combined water and brine condensers (f), (g). A 40 – 48 % aqueous solution of acetic acid condenses at about 0 °C and is separated (h) from the cleavage gas (0 – 10 °C). About 4 – 8 % of this acetic acid results from the reaction of the condensed acetic anhydride with water.;Two processes are available for the reaction of ketene with acetic acid. The classical scrubber process is being replaced gradually by the Wacker process with liquid-ring pumping. After the reaction with the ketene with acetic acid, the raw anhydride is distilled.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed for each reaction.;References:;Held, H., Rengstl, A., Mayer, D.: Acetic anhydride and mixed fatty acid anhy-drides.
