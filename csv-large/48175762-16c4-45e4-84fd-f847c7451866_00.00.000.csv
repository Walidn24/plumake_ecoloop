Net production is the gross production minus about 1% losses. Additionally there is energy needed for pumping. The efficiency of a pumped storage hydropower plant is around 70% (p.14 in Bauer et al. 2007)",00.00.000,"hydro power,Sector: Electricity",2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Argentina,ecoinvent Data Quality System
