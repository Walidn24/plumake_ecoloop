No waste gas or effluent treatment is considered. A production of 0.3 kg charcoal/kg wood is assumed. 2.93 kg of CO2 are formed during the combustion of 1 kg charcoal. Here it is assumed that the by-products of the pyrolysis (methanol, acetic acid, etc.) can be used (0.23 kg/kg wood), but all environmental impacts of the production are allocated to the main product charcoa (Briane et al., 1985)l.; ;Production of 1 kg charcoal, incl. wood drying process, uses 2.5 MJ heat, 0.075 kWh electricity and 50 l cooling water. It is assumed that wood boilers provide the remaining heat of 0.9 MJ/kg charcoal (Brocksiepe, 1997).  ;;Construction work is mainly human labour. Often there are no fixed plants but production sites are located near the forest with no fixed infrastructure parts. ;Reference:;Rosillo-Calle F., de Rezende M. A. A., Furtado P. and Hall D. O.
