This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for woodfree, uncoated paper. It includes estimates for average transport requirements from producing to using entity. Woodfree, uncoated paper (also called uncoated fine paper) is one of the most important categories of graphical paper. It contains most of the office papers (e.g. business forms, copier, computer, stationery and book paper). Woodfree paper is defined as containing at least 90% of the fibres in form of chemical pulp. Uncoated paper is defined as not being coated with a coating material like kaolin or calcium carbonate. 

This dataset starts with woodfree, uncoated paper leaving the gate of the producing entity, ready for distribution to using entities.

This dataset includes the transport from the production site to a central distribution site for woodfree, uncoated paper.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Pulp & Paper",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
