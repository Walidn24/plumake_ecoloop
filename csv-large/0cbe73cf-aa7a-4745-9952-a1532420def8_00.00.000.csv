Starch is applied to the tips of the flutes on one side and the inner liner is glued to the fluting. The corrugated fluting medium with liner attached to it is called single face web and travels along the machine towards the Double Backer where the single face web meets the outer liner and forms corrugated board. A number of layers of single faced web may be built up to produce double and triple wall corrugated board. The corrugated board is slit into the required widths and cut into sheets which are then stacked or palletised. The final stage of the process consists of printing and then slotting, folding and gluing the corrugated board to manufacture a corrugated box.",00.00.000,Sector: Pulp & Paper,2021-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
