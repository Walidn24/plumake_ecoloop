The ore is dissolved in sulfuric acid and insoluble residues such as silica and aluminum are removed. Solvent extraction is applied us-ing organic solvents such as ammonium di-2-ethylhexyl phosphate/di-2-ethylhexyl phos-phoric acid/kerosene (DAP). Ammonium carbonate solution is used to separate beryllium from the organic phase. Since the organic phase is returned to the process it is not accounted for. Metal impurities are removed by heat treatment. ,00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
