This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat, from steam, in chemical industry', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced with the average fuel mix used in the chemical and petrochemical industry. It is to be used for heat energy in an average chemical plant. ;This market is supplied exclusively by the activity ""steam production, as energy carrier, in chemical industry"". Other activities that produce steam as byproduct are excluded, so that consumers of steam get by default supplied with steam produced using the average energy mix that is estimated to be used for steam production in the chemical industry within the geography of this market. ;;The production volume is set equal to that of the supplying transforming activity. It is calculated based on data from the IEA, according to which the current ""global energy demand for the chemical industry is 15 EJ per year (EJ/yr) excluding feedstock"" (IEA, 2013). Roughly 40% of the energy is assumed to be delivered in the form of steam, based on data for the United States (JISEA, 2016). Furthermore, the production volume of the dataset covering the geography of Europe (RER) has been subtracted, in order to account only for the production of steam occurring in the rest of the world.;;References:;International Energy Agency (2013).

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, from steam, in chemical industry',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  heat, from steam, in chemical industry', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,Sector: Heat; Chemicals,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
