The most efficient way of ammonia synthesis gas production is natural gas reforming with steam and air. The ammonia production process consists of several steps: desulphurization, primary production, secondary reforming, shift conversion, CO2 removal, methanation, synthesis gas compression and ammonia synthesis.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
