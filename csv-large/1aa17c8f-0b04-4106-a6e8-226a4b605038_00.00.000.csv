The demand for chemical purity imposed by the users means that a number of purification techniques are required. About 1 – 2 % of zinc oxide is produced by the wet process, 10 – 20 % by the direct process, and the remainder by the indirect process.;References:;Hischier R., Classen M., Lehmann M. and Scharnhorst W.
