This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'acrylic varnish, without water, in 87.5% solution state', in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;acrylic varnish, without water, in 87.5% solution state'  is an acrylic varnish from acrylic binder. It describes a typical water-reducible alkyd paint. It is made from a long oil alkyd resin as used in architectural paints of white colour. The white colour  is achieved by the addition of titanium dioxide. This dataset represents a pure substance (100% active substance). Industrially, this product is mostly used in 87.5% solution state. Modelling this substance in a solution requires the user to add the water and/or solvent in their models.  On a consumer level, is used in the following products: protecting paintings from sunlight or from dust getting embedded into the surface. This temporary surface will collect dust, smoke, dirt, etc. over time, dulling and darkening the painting.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'acrylic varnish, without water, in 87.5% solution state',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'acrylic varnish, without water, in 87.5% solution state',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
