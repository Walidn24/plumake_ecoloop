NCA hydroxide and lithium hydroxide are mixed and heated in the calcination kiln over two or three rounds of mixing and calcination. Oxygen is also add to the mixture.The resulting material is crushed, sieved and demagnetized to obtain NCA oxide. The production process is completely automated and almost all electricity consumption is attributed to the calcination kiln. The facility can achieve an overall material efficiency of approximately100%.;;The general reaction is the following:;;NCA(OH)2 + LiOH + 0.25 O2 --> Li-NCA-O2 + 2.5 H20;Reference: ;;Dai, Q., Kelly, J.
