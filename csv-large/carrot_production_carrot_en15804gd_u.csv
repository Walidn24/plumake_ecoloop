This dataset is a weighted average of the regional datasets, with weights based on production volume of the reference product.  Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.;Sum of regional production volumes: 1.667e+10 kg;CN: PV = 1.590e+10 kg; weight = 0.9539;NL: PV = 5.088e+8 kg; weight = 0.03052;IL: PV = 2.599e+8 kg; weight = 0.01559;Yield of the global dataset = 35996.3522492 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the CN regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of carrots. The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 35 t/ha. The data are representative for carrot production in China used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 130-40-40 kg/ha. Organic fertilisers applied amount to 6 m3/ha of liquid manure and 5 t/ha of solid manure. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 4.3 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The export share of carrots produced in China amounts to 23% of the global export (tonnage exported in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing carrots produced in China for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 2.8 (i.e. good quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters

This activity starts with soil cultivation after the harvest of the previous crop.

This activity ends with the harvest of the carrots and their transport to the farm gate. The dataset includes all machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations are: soil cultivation, sowing, fertilisation, pesticide application, harvesting, and on-farm transport. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. The inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered. The dataset doesn't include emissions from manure storage because these are within the system boundary of animal production.  Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered.
Statistical data from FAO used to assess land use change is incomplete for China. The original land use of 40.9% of annual cropland and 100% of perennial cropland transformed in the last 20 years is unknown. Land use change impacts may therefore be underestimated.",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
