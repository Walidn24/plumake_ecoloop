The plants are used for basic load with 6000 hours of operation at full capacity per year. The plants are assumed to operate 200000 hours during its lifetime.;Average installed technology.; - Share of installed capacity with desulfurisation: 20% (rough estimation based on sulfur mass balance; - Average efficiency of desulfurisation installations: 92% (rough estimation based on Dones et al. 2007; - Share of installed capacity with denitrification: 73% (figure based on IEA 2012 ); - Average efficiency of denitrification installations: 80% (estimation based on Dones et al. 2007, p.128.
