In terms of quantity, mineral oil components continue to be the most important ingredients. But more and more, derivatives of natural, harvestable raw materials from the oleo-chemical sector are finding their acceptance within the used substances.;In 1999 around 37 Mt of lubricants have been consumed – thereof more than half in the automotive sector (56%), and another 29% as industrial lubricants. This amount is produced by around 1700 producers worldwide. Thereof, about 200 are vertically-integrated petroleum companies where lubricants are only a minor part of their profit. Nevertheless, less than 2% of all lubricant manufacturers are producing more than 60% of the total production volume. In case of the remaining 1500 companies, lubricants are their core business. ;In terms of the volume, base oils are the most important parts of lubricants. The rest is composed of additives. For this dataset, the additives are based on data published in Raimondi et al. (2012).;The image above represents the typical yields of the different cuts from a conventional lubricating oil refining process ;To achieve base oils, a variety of different steps have to be done starting with the crude oil that is extracted until the right components are isolated. Different steps therefore are for example refining, distillation, de-asphalting, traditional refining process, solvent dewaxing or finishing. Additional steps that are often used are as well hydrogenation and hydrocracking operations. ;Based on the fact that a multitude of different processes are possible for the production of lubricants, the following choices are done for this dataset – with the aim to create a typical dataset for petrochemical lubricants – called “lubricants”:;-	Hydrocracking as basic technology for the extraction of the lubricant oils due to the fact that according to Bartels et al. (2003) more than 50% of the new manufacturing plants work with this principle.;-	Distillation and dewaxing as subsequent process steps to achieve high-quality base lubricant oils;-	Diesel as input due to the fact that these hydrocracker need low-sulphur oils.;References:;Bartels T., Bock W., Braun J., Busch C., Dresel W., Freiler C., Harperscheid M., Heckler R.-P., Hörner D., Kubicki F., Lingg G., Losch A., Luther R., Mang T., Noll S. and Omeis J.
