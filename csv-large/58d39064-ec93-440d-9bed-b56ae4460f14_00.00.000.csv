For each kilogram of phenol produced, 0.62 kg of acetone are obtained. The process consists of two fundamental chemical reactions: cumene oxidation with oxygen to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). CHP is then cleaved to phenol and acetone by using a strong mineral acid or zeolite-based catalyst.;Chemical reaction:;C9H12 + R°-> C9H12° C9H12° + O2 ->C6H6O + C3H6O;The oxidation of cumene is usually carried out in a series of bubble column reactors. Fresh as well as recycled cumene are fed to the first reactor with oxygen acting as an oxidant in each reactor. The bubble columns are operated at pressures ranging from atmospheric to about 700 kPa and temperatures in the range 80 –120 °C. The temperature can be controled by internal or external heat exchangers. The condensed cumene is recycled to the oxidation reactors. The CHP concentration in the oxidation product is increased by vacuum distillation in column to about 65-90 %. In a second step, the formed CHP is cleaved to phenol and acetone. For this, a series of heat exchangers within a circulation loop are used as reactors because the reaction is very fast and exothermic. The CHP is spontaneously diluted in the circulation product, which consists of phenol, acetone, cumene, and several byproducts as well as residual amounts of CHP. Normally sulfuric acid is used as the catalyst at a concentration of several hundred parts per million by weight. The temperature is in the range 40 – 80 °C at atmospheric pressure.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;Reference(s):;Chauvel, Alain, Gilles Lefebvre, and L.
