This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'lime, hydraulic', in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;The product ""lime, hydraulic"" represents a binder, which is produced from marl lime or calcareous marl by calcination below the sintering point (temperature of calcination: around 1’050ºC, max. 1’200ºC). The basic material must have a share of 65 to 75% in calcium carbonate. The calcined hydraulic lime is slaked and milled. To regulate the cementation, gypsum is added during the grinding process. Compared to cement, the SiO2 content of hydraulic lime is varying strongly (5 - 30%). No content of Alit (tricalcium silicate), a high content of Belit (dicalcium silicate) and a higher amount of lime (>5%) are typical for hydraulic lime. Further significant differences to cement are better working properties but worse hydraulic characteristics and lower strength (1 – 5 N/mm2). It is the main raw material for the production of masonry cement or plastering mortar. 

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'lime, hydraulic',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  lime, hydraulic', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Minerals; Cement & Concrete",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
