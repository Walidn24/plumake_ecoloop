This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market is representing local market for sand in Switzerland. A swiss market for sand was created based on literature. According to The Swiss Geological Survey - the authority for subsurface, published in 2017 by Federal Office of Topography swisstopo “Switzerland can cover most of its requirements of mineral commodities, such as gravel and sand, gypsum, salt and raw materials for cement, from domestic mining sites.” ;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;The product ""sand"" represents an average type of sand extracted. Sand is co-produced with gravel where production of 1 kg represents 35% sand and 65% gravel. The largest use of construction sand and gravel is as aggregate for the production of concrete. The second largest use is as foundation material for highways, railways, runways, etc. Other major uses include aggregate for hot mix asphalt, and filler for highway, dam, and other back-filling. Smaller volumes of construction sand and gravel are used in plaster and gunite sands, snow and ice control, and railroad ballast.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'sand',  within the geography of Switzerland.

This activity ends with the supply of 'sand',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Minerals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
