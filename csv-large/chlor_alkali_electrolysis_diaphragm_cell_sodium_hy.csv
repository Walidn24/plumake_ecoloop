A diaphragm is used to separate the feed brine (anolyte) and the chlorine formed at the anode from the sodium hydroxide containing solution (catholyte) and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. Without the diaphragm being present during electrolysis, chlorine and hydrogen would form an explosive mixture and sodium hydroxide and chlorine would react to form sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Diaphragms used to be made from asbestos but up-todate technology allows for asbestos-free polymer-based diaphragms. Purified brine is fed to the anode compartment and percolates through the diaphragm into the cathode compartment. The percolation rate is controlled by a difference in liquid level between both compartments. At the anodes (metal oxide coated titanium), chlorine gas is formed which is collected and directed to further processing. Cathodes, where water decomposition takes place, are made of activated carbon steel. Catholyte leaving the cell, also called cell liquor, is a mixture of 10-12 wt.-% sodium hydroxide and 15-17 wt.-% sodium chloride in water. This solution is usually evaporated to 50 wt.-% NaOH. In this process, simultaneously most of the salt is removed by precipitation to a final residual of 1 wt.-%. The resulting salt is typically recirculated to brine preparation. The advantage of diaphragm cells is that the quality requirements for the brine and the electrical energy consumption are low. Disadvantageous are the high amount of thermal energy necessary for sodium hydroxide concentration and the comparably low quality of the produced sodium hydroxide and chlorine.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
