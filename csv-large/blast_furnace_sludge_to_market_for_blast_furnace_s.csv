This is a renaming activity. Its purpose is to link 'blast furnace sludge' to the 'market for blast furnace sludge, for recovery'. This represents the share of blast furnace sludge that is recovered for use via internal (in iron and steelmaking) or external routes (e.g. cement making).Through this renaming, the by-product classification of the blast furnace sludge is changed from 'waste' to 'recyclable material'.

Activity starts with the reception of 'blast furnace sludge'.

Activity ends with the 'blast furnace sludge, for recovery' being ready for transportation.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling; Metals,2020-01-01,2025-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
