Ultimate average landfill height is 20 meters. Operation phase duration is 30 years. The total raw landfill gas mass produced in the landfill from this waste is 0.05901 kg. The total CH4 mass in the raw landfill gas is 0.05032 kg. Percentage of landfill gas directly emitted is 47w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and flared is 18.02w%. Percentage of landfill gas captured and utilised is 34.98%. Conversion efficiencies are 27.8e% for electricity and 13.5e% for useful heat.  Leachate collected during the first 100 years is collected and treated region-specifically before emission. Based on average waste composition and climate data the end of carbonate phase is estimated to be reached 2'383 years after waste deposition.,00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,1994-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
