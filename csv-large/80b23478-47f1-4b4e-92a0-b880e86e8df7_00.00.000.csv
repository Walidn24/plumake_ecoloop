The purification and liquefaction of various components of air, in particular oxygen, nitrogen and argon, is an important industrial process, and it is called cryogenic air separation. ;Cryogenic distillation accounts for approximately 85% of nitrogen and over 95% of oxygen production. It is the preferred supply mode for high volume and high purity requirements (Praxair 2002). Cryogenic air separation is currently the most efficient and cost-effective technology for producing large quantities of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon as gaseous or liquid products (Smith & Klosek 2001). Besides the air needed as a resource the major input for the liquefying process is the electricity to compress the inlet air, which normally comprises 95% of the utility costs of a cryogenic air separation plant.  In some plants the amount of processed air (in Nm3) can be up to 5 times larger than the derived liquid products (Cryogenmash 2001). In these plants, the waste gas stream is naturally also much larger (in order to obtain the mass balance). As output of the cryogenic air separation there are three products: liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and liquid crude argon. The assumed process includes no gaseous co-products. In reality gaseous products are also processed if there is a demand at the production site. The investigated cryogenic air separation process leads to liquid products in the following quality:;-	Liquid oxygen: min. 99.6 wt-%;-	Liquid nitrogen: min. 99.9995 wt-%;-	Liquid argon, crude: 96-98 wt-%;An air pre-treatment section downstream of the air compression (0.7 MPa) and after cooling removes process contaminants, including water, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. The air is then cooled to cryogenic temperatures and distilled into oxygen, nitrogen, and, optionally, argon streams. Alternate compressing and expanding the recycled air can liquefy most of it.;Numerous configurations of heat exchange and distillation equipment can separate air into the required product streams. These process alternatives are selected based on the purity and number of product streams, required trade-offs between capital costs and power consumption, and the degree of integration between the air separate unit and other facility units. This process requires very complicated heat integration techniques because the only heat sink for cooling or condensation is another cryogenic stream in the process.;Since the boiling point of argon is between that of oxygen and nitrogen, it acts as an impurity in the product streams. If argon were collected and separated from the oxygen product, an oxygen purity of less than 95% by volume would result (Barron & Randall 1985). On the other hand, if argon were collected with the nitrogen product, the purity of nitrogen would not exceed 98.7% by volume. To achieve higher purities of oxygen and nitrogen the elimination of argon is necessary.;Commercial argon is the product of cryogenic air separation, where liquefaction and distillation processes are used to produce a low-purity crude argon product. ;Praxair (2002) Gases > Nitrogen > Production of Nitrogen.
