The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a national average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 90.6 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 0%-11.2%-88.8%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 39.94kg O. Generated waste-specific raw sludge is treated with anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces 38490 litres of biogas with an energy content of 891.2MJ. 23.6% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 26.564%. The gross thermal efficiency is 47.853%. After digestion, the remaining total sludge mass (dry matter) is 31.57kg DM.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
