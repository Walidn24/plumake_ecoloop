According to Haupt (2018), tinplate mostly enters the recycling without prior detinning. Since the regional process for detinning in Switzerland was unavailable for confidentiality reasons, it was assumed that the full amount of tinplate from processes that produce it gets recycled without prior detinning. This renaming activity therefore converts 'tinplate scrap, sorted' into 'iron scrap, sorted, pressed'.;Literature: Melanie Haupt, Thomas KÃ¤gi, Stefanie Hellweg, 2018, Life cycle inventories of waste management processes., Data in Brief, 19, 1441-1457.
