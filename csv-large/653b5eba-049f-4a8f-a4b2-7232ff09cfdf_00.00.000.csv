This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for 'nitrogen, liquid', in the geography of Europe. This is a constrained market for consequential system model, for attributional system models, this is a regular market. In the case of consequential system model, details about the marginal consumer can be found in the comment of the conditional exchange (by-product).;This is a constrained market, i.e. it contains a conditional exchange which is activated only during consequential linking.;;Nitrogen, liquid is produced always only as a by-product of different activities. This means, that its production volume is always dependent on the amount of reference product produced in those activities. The consequence of this is, that the market for nitrogen, liquid is not fully flexible, but constrained. In case when the demand increases the supply will not increase.;Special transport modelling for liquid gases: No ship transport and normal transport modelling for chemicals reduced by 90%.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'nitrogen, liquid',  within the geography of Europe.

This activity ends with the supply of 'nitrogen, liquid',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"constrained market,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
