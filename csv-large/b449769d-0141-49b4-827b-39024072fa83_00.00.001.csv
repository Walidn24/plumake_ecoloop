This dataset represents the interventions associated with the clear-cutting of primary forest for the provision of arable land tenure, annual crop. NPP (net primary productivity of a given land, in kg C / m2 and year) and VEG (above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and dead organic matter) values are parameterized. ;VEG values and production volumes are derived from the Appendix S1 and S2 of Novaes et al. 2017. The most updated data is available in www.cnpma.embrapa.br/forms/BRLUC.php. In this reference, VEG values of primary forests and grassland were estimated based in Brazil, 2016 and croplands, pasture man made and forest intensive VEG values based in European Commission, 2010 and weighted according to climate categories occurrence per state. NPP values are reported by Haberl et al. (2007) and the average value for Latin America is adopted. The types of exchanges and their emission factors are the same from land transformations datasets 'clear-cutting, primary forest to arable land, annual crop, BR, 2010 - 2015' and 'land already in use, annual cropland to annual crop, BR, 2010 - 2015' available in Ecoinvent database (Rossi, 2017a,b), which in turn were retrieved from Andrea & Merlet (2001).;Bibliography is listed below:;- Andrea, M.O., Merlet, P.

This activity starts with the natural state of primary forest.

The dataset includes the carbon stored in Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), Below-Ground Biomass (BGB) and Dead Organic Matter (DOM) pools. It includes the fluxes from these carbon pools in terms of CO2 and other trace gases caused by the burning of biomass. It also includes a rough estimation for the machine use required for the clear-cutting, with emissions and ocupation exchanges based in an European model. 
The loss/gain of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) usually associated with a land tranformation is accounted for in the downstream activity using the arable land tenure, given that it depends on the subsequent land use practice. 
This activity ends with the provision of arable land tenure, measured in unit kg carbon Potential Net Primary Production (NPP0).",00.00.001,2024-10-22 14:27:50.538,"BRLUC,Sector: Land Use",2014-01-01,2023-12-31,"Brazil, Bahia",ecoinvent Data Quality System
