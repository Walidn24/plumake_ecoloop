This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'nuclear fuel element, for pressure water reactor, UO2 3.9% & MOX', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;'nuclear fuel element, for pressure water reactor, UO2 3.9% & MOX' is a nuclear fuel. The exchange reflects the use of uranium dioxide and MOX (mixed metal oxides) fuel elements in current pressure water nuclear reactors. This mix consists of 87% uranium dioxide (3.9%, enriched) and 13% MOX.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'nuclear fuel element, for pressure water reactor, UO2 3.9% & MOX',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'nuclear fuel element, for pressure water reactor, UO2 3.9% & MOX',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals; Fuels",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
