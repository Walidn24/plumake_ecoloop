The reaction is catalysed homogeneously in a closed system. The reaction product is  separated in several distillation steps. The desired product (99.5% of reaction product), 1-methoxy-2-propanol, is recovered in the second distillation column. 1-Methoxy-2-propanol has two enantiomers, this dataset describes the application of a racemic mixture.;Chemical reaction:;C3H6O + CH4O --> C4H10O2;Reference(s):;Bosen S.
