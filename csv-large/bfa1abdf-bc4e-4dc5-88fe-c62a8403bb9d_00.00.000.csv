This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'structural timber', in the geography of Europe.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This dataset represents the market for structural timber in Europe.;Structural timber is a building material with precisely defined product characteristics, which was developed specially to meet the high requirements of modern timber construction. Structural timber is a kiln-dried, strength-graded, and in most cases finger-jointed timber product made of solid softwood. Thanks to the method of cutting used and the low moisture content of the material it has little propensity for cracking, is dimensionally stable and, subject to due observance of the rules relating to the structural protection of wood, can also be used without wood preservatives. Structural timber is available in a wide range of preferred dimensions and wood types (spruce, fir, pine, larch or Douglas fir) with precisely defined surface finishes.;Reference:;Rüter, S. and S.
