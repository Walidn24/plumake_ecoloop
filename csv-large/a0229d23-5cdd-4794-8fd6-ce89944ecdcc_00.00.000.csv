The amounts of materials both on the input and on the output are calculated using stoichiometric equation relations. In order to produce 1 kg of  rutile (95% TiO2, i.e. 0.95 kg of TiO2), 1.687 kg of titanium oxochloride (TiOCl2) is needed and 0.867 kg of hydrochloric acid is produced as by-product. 95% of this hydrochloric acid is recycled and returned back to the process. In order to produce 1.687 kg of oxochloride (TiOCl2), 1.922 kg of hydrochloride acid (HCl) and 2 kg of ilmenite (FeTiO3) is needed. When the recycled amount of hydrochloric acid is deducted the make-up amount is then (1.922-0.867*0.95=) 1.098kg.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,India,ecoinvent Data Quality System
