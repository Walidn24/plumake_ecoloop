This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'butadiene', in the Global geography.;This product is generally considered to be used at the production site.  Therefore, the market does not contain any transport.;butadiene', is a plastic product of fossil origin. It is a precursor substance meant to be used for the further production of plastics. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure, colourless with a mild gasoline-like odour. The product is used in the following applications and sectors: adhesives and sealants, anti-freeze products, coating products, fillers, putties, plasters, modelling clay, finger paints, non-metal-surface treatment products, inks and toners, leather treatment products, lubricants and greases, polishes and waxes, polymers and textile treatment products and dyes.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'butadiene',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  butadiene', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
