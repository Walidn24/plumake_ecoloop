Suitable for informal recycling (e.g. burning of e-waste). Based on Municipal waste incineration without any pollution control. Residues (minus any actually recycled metals) are left on site. Assumption of share of thermal NOx to total NOx in average waste burning process is 30%. Contribution from thermal NOx is 810mg per kg waste.
