In the first step, powdered silicon is reacted with hydrochloric acid at about 300 °C to produce trichlorosilane, HSiCl3, along with hydrogen gas, according to the chemical equation:;Si + 3HCl → HSiCl3 + H2;The hydrogen is re-used in other silicon purification processes and therefore not considered as co-product. In the second step, catalytic disproportionation of trichlorosilane results in SiH4 and SiCl4. For a mixture of trichloro- and dichlorosilane, copper, a mixture of silica and alumina at 300 °C, and quaternary ammonium groups bonded to carbon in an ion-exchange resin have been reported as catalysts for the main reaction leading to silicon tetrahydride. ;4 HSiCl3 → 2 H2SiCl2 + 2 SiCl4;2 H2SiCl2 → SiCl4+ SiH4;Purification ;In-process purification is achieved by contacting part of the silicon tetrahydride produced with the starting mixture of chlorosilanes, which contains the impurities as chlorides, chiefly those of arsenic, phosphorus, and boron. This procedure converts the contaminants into their more volatile hydrides, which are removed with the off-gas.;Removal of boron compounds from silanes that are to be used for the production of high-purity silicon is very important. When SiH4 is produced from alkali metal hydrides, it is recommended that water should be added to hydrolyze boron hydrides under the alkaline reaction conditions. Water vapor is added during distillation for the same reason. Boron compounds can be removed from SiH4 by adsorption from the gas phase onto activated carbon or silica carriers loaded with compounds that form complexes with boron compounds (AlCl3, FeCl3, C2H5CN, NH2CN, PCl3).;If alkali metal hydrides MH are reacted in organic solvents, it is often unnecessary to include a special stage for removing boron compounds from the silicon compounds, as the former react to form boranate complexes under the following conditions: ;References:;Simmer, Walter: Silicon Compounds, Inorganic.
