This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'furnace, wood chips, hardwood storage area, 300kW', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a hardwood wood chips furnace that includes the storage area. It has a lifetime of 20 years for the furnace the automatic control system,  80 years for the chimney, while its operation time is 2,100 h/year and capacity of 300 kW. A furnace of this capacity is used to heat a large building complex or to supply a smaller heat network. The process includes the most important materials used for the fabrication of the furnace, the water storage and the chimney, their decommission, hardwood storage and energy used for the construction. 

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
