This is achieved according the following overall reaction equation:;NaCl + 3H2O + 6e- → NaClO3 + 3H2;The concentrated chlorate solution is either submitted to crystallisation or it is used directly, particularly in the production of chlorine dioxide. Sodium chlorate, hydrogen gas (H2) and heat are formed in the production process. The solution formed is crystallised and the chlorate crystals are separated, washed and dried. The final product contains mostly 99 to 99.9% sodium chlorate. The hydrogen gas and the heat produced can be exported for different uses. The main raw materials are sodium chloride and water. Energy is provided by electrical power.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
