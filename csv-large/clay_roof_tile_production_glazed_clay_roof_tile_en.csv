This dataset corresponds to manufacturing of a clay roof tile, (glazed) factory, which incorporates machinery in their processes. ;The manufacturing process includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming by extrusion, drying, first firing, varnishing, second firing, cooling and storage of tiles. For both firing, wood is used. Varnishing and the second process of firing are done in order to produce glazed tiles. These processes make use of two chemicals (lead oxide and silica), and increase the amount of wood used for the oven. The process begins by the mixing of raw materials. The mix is deposited in a mill, then moved an extruder formed by a mixer and a matrix.
