After a hydrogenation of the catalyst, ethylene is inserted into the aluminium-carbon bond of this molecule to build up the carbon chain. This step is then followed by a growth reaction of the aluminium alkyls to aluminium alcoholates by oxidation with air. These are then subsequently hydrolysed to alcohols, as shown in the process steps listed.;Flow diagram of the Ziegler process for the production of petrochemical fatty alcohols:;The different process reactions: Hydrogenation [1], ethylation [2], growth reaction [3], oxidation [4] and final hydrolysis [5];2) Oxo process: this process constitutes a hydroformylation in which long chain olefins are reacted with hydrogen and carbon monoxide. An intermediate aldehyde is formed, which is subsequently reduced by hydrogen. ;Flow diagram of the oxo process for the production of petrochemical fatty alcohols:;Reference:;Noweck K.
