Further improvement options for the process are mainly a further reduction of energy consumption by heat recovery, reduction of emissions with environmental technology and use of sustainable biogenic carbon sources instead of fossil carbon sources.;Reference:;Jungbluth N., Stucki M, and Frischknecht R.
