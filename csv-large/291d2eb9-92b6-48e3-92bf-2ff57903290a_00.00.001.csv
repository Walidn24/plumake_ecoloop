Trees are felled using a chainsaw. Lianas on the trees to be felled are cut about six months previously, which prevents connected trees to be pulled down with the felling of one tree. After the crown is lopped off the trees are crosscut into logs below the first branches and these logs are extracted with the use of a cable and powerwinch by a crawler tractor (Komatsu) from the felling position to the skidding track.;;Heavy crawler tractors are used to haul trees from their felling location to the temporary log landings. Tractors are restricted to skidding tracks. The temporary log landings are located within the forest area and are traversed by heavy machinery, such as the tractors and San-tai-wong (6x6 trucks). These carry logs from the temporary log landings in the forest along permanent forest roads to the permanent logyards next to the main roads. ;;Branchings are assumed to be burned on site; the amount of branchings and respective emissions from biomass burning are estimated based on literature (EPA, 1995 and IPCC, 2003).;References:;Collins, M., K.
