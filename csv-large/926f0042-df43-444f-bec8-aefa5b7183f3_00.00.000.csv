NMC111 hydroxide and lithium carbonate are mixed and heated in the calcination kiln over two rounds of mixing and calcination. Finally, the resulting material is crushed, sieved and demagnetized to obtain NMC111 oxide. The production process is completely automated and almost all electricity consumption is attributed to the calcination kiln. The facility can achieve an overall material efficiency of approximately100%. ;;Thegeneral reaction is the following:;NMC(OH)2 + Li2CO3 --> Li-NMC-O2 + CO2 + H2O.;Reference: ;;Dai, Q., Kelly, J.
