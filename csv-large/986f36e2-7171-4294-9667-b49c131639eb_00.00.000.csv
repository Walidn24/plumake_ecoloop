In this dataset, the SO2 production from the combustion of sulfur is chosen as the representative process: sulfur from natural deposits or from sulfur recovery is combusted in a chamber. The SO2 gas content is generally up to 18% by volume. This process is exothermic.;Chemical reaction formula:;S + O2 (g) → SO2;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
