This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'SOx retained, in hard coal flue gas desulfurisation', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;'SOx retained, in hard coal flue gas desulfurisation'  describes the inorganic sulfur oxides retained by flue gas desulfurisation process of a hard coal power plant. It is called 'sulfur oxides' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: SOx. It is gaseous under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. It is modelled as a mix of pure sulfur oxides.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'SOx retained, in hard coal flue gas desulfurisation',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  SOx retained, in hard coal flue gas desulfurisation', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
