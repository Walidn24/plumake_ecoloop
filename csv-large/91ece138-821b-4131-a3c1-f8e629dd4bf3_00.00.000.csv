They are currently most often equipped with low NOx type burners, which use primary measures for the reduction of NOx emissions (natural gas staging technique or/and flue gas recirculation). ;2) water tube boiler, which comprises many tubes connected to 1 or 2 tanks; the upper tank containing the water-steam emulsion, and the lower tank containing water.;Schematic view of a water tube boiler:;Most often this type of boiler is built specifically according to the power and specifications required. The range of powers starts at 15 or 20 MWt, up to several hundreds of MWth, and even beyond. They are currently most often equipped with low NOx type burners, that use natural gas staging technique or/and internal flue gas recirculation.;Reference:;Zah R., Hischier R.
