This dataset represents the treatment of non-exhaust emissions produced by road abrasion from an average passenger car. The datasets are treatments because they represent a removal of substances from the technosphere (removal of road material).;;This dataset represents the operation of an average passenger car. ;;Calculation of non-exhaust emissions (tyre, brake and road wear emissions as well as petrol evaporation emissions) are based on: Ntziachristos, L., Boulter, P. (2009). EMEP/EEA air pollutant emissions inventory guidebook 2009: Road vehicle tyre and brake wear; Road surface wear. Copenhagen, European Environment Agency.;;The emission factors relate to 1kg road wear. The quantity of road wear emissions per kg vehicle and km is then defined in the transport datasets.;;The road wear emissions are to air, water and soil. All particulates are accounted for as emissions to air and have particle sizes below 100um. Anything above this does not remain airborne over longer periods. Total particulates equals total of all air emission substances. The fractions to water and soil are calculated by deducting the airborne emissions from the total tyre wear. This remaining amount is then simply split 50/50 between water and soil.
