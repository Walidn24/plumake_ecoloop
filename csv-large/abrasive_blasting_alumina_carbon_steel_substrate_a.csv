The abrasive considered for this activity is alumina powder. Considering the specificity of the activity, this activity should be used only for the preparation of the workpieces for thermal spray coating.;The machine uses compressed air with a gauge pressure of 550 kPa. This dataset is considered to be valid for a carbon steel substrate.;The alumina is considered to be reused. The calculation is based on the condition of the pilot plant: 100g of alumina reused for 100 50x20mm specimens.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2022-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
