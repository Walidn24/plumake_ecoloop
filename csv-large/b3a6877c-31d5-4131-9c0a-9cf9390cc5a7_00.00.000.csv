The reaction is a highly exothermic process and is used to produce steam. The reaction gases are cooled and maleic anhydride is condensed and removed from the vapor stream. This is carried out quickly in order to avoid the production of maleic acid formed from the water in the reaction gases. Maleic acid is also recovered from the water scrubber. Waste gases are burned. (Wells, 1999);2 C4H10 + 7 O2 -> C4H2O3 + 8 H2O;The reaction occurs at slightly elevated pressure and temperatures of 400 – 430 °C. In the reaction area, n-butane and air can be fed to a fluid-bed catalytic reactor to produce maleic anhydride. Cooling coils are included in the fluid bed to generate high-pressure steam N-butane can also be is vaporized, mixed with air and catalytically oxidized in a fixed bed tubular reactor. ;Regarding the catalytic system, vanadium oxides are used on different  promoters such as phosphorus and the oxides of Fe, Cr, Ti, Co, Ni, Mo (such as V2O5-H3PO4).;The treated exhaust gas contains undreacted butane and carbon monoxide, and thus, is being combusted. ;In this dataset, a yield of 63% was assumed, according to Wells (1999). Please note that the catalytic system is not covered.;;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
