This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'biomethane, high pressure, vehicle grade', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;biomethane, high pressure, vehicle grade' is a non-fossil fuel with a calorific value of 46.5 MJ/kg. It is used as a gaseous fuel and is sourced from biogas purification or from synthetic gas.  Its main applications are in the following sectors: biofuel, industrial and district heat and electricity. 

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'biomethane, high pressure, vehicle grade',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  biomethane, high pressure, vehicle grade', to the consumers of this product.
