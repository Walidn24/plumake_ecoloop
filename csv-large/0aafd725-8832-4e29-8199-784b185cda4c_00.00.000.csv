Different production techniques can be distinguished. All of them are either high-pressure reactions without any catalysts or catalytic reactions at low pressure. Within each of the reactions, the three steps of synthesis, melamine recovery and purification as well as off-gas treatment can be distinguished. Due to lack of data about the different methods, for this dataset a 50:50 mix of the BASF process (as representative for the low pressure reactions) and of the Montedison process (example of high pressure process) is used.;In the first case (BASF process), alumina is used as a catalyst. The reaction temperature is about 400째C and for the fluidization, an ammonia-carbon dioxide mixture is added. The off-gas treatment has several steps that remove melamine and unreacted urea. The remaining off-gas is partly used as the above mentioned fluidization gas, partly as quentching gas in the crystallizer unit. ;In case of the Montedison process, the operation temperature is about 370째C and the pressure is around 7 MPa. Besides urea, ammonia is also feed into the reactor. In the following quencher, this mixture is treated with an aqueous solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide resulting in a precipitation of melamine. The remaining mixture of ammonia and carbon dioxide is recycled either in a urea or in other fertilizer production sites. ;In the beginning of the 90s, the worldwide production capacity of melamine was in the order of 550 kt. Thereof, 230 kt are in Europe, 175 kt in Middle and Far East and only 97 kt in the United States.;6 H2N-CO-NH2    ->     C3N3(NH2)3     +     6 NH3     +    3 CO2 ;References:;Crews G.
