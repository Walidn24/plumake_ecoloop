The most convenient method of production is the reaction between sodium arsenide and water. The sodium hydroxide is then neutralized with hydrochloric acid.;;AsNa3 + 3 H2O → AsH3 + 3 NaOH;;NaOH + HCl → H2O + NaCl;;These reactions are fast and complete and have the advantage that the product is not contaminated with hydrogen;.;Grund, S., Hanusch K., Wolf H.
