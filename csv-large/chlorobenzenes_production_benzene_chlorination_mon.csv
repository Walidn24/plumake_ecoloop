Hydrogen chloride is formed as a by-product. Generally, mixtures of isomers and compounds with varying degrees of chlorination are obtained, because any given chlorobenzene can be further chlorinated up to the stage of hexa-chlorobenzene. Because of the directing influence exerted by chlorine, the unfavoured products 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene are formed to only a small extent if at all. The velocity of chlorination for an individual chlorine compound depends on the compound's structure and, because of this, both the degree of chlorination and also the isomer ratio change continuously during the course of reaction. Sets of data on the composition of products from different reactions are only comparable if they refer to identical reaction conditions and materials having the same degree of chlorination. By altering the reaction conditions and changing the catalyst, one can vary the ratios of different chlorinated products within certain limits. Lewis acids (FeCl3, AlCl3, SbCl3, MnCl2, MoCl2, SnCl4, TiCl4) are used as principal catalysts. The usual catalyst employed in large scale production is ferric chloride, with or without the addition of sulfur compounds.;The ratio of resulting chlorobenzenes to one another is also influenced by the benzene:chlorine ratio. For this reason, the highest selectivity is achieved in batch processes. If the same monochlorobenzene:dichlorobenzene ratio expected from a batch reactor is to result from continuous operation in a single-stage reactor, then a far lower degree of benzene conversion must be accepted as a consequence of the low benzene:chlorine ratio). ;The reaction is highly exothermic:;C6H6 + Cl2 --> C6H5Cl + HCl ; delta H = -131.5 kJ/mol;Unwanted heat of reaction can be dissipated either by circulating some of the reactor fluid through an external heat exchanger or by permitting evaporative cooling to occur at the boiling temperature. Circulation cooling has the advantage of enabling the reaction temperature to be varied in accordance with the requirements of a given situation. Evaporative cooling is more economical, however.;Fractional distillation separates the products.
