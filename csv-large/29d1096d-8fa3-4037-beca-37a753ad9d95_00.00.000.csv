The dataset covers the main technologies for concrete block production in Ecuador. The manufacturing process begins by dosing and mixing the cement, aggregates and water. In the block machine, the steel cast is filled with the mix and the block is shaped and compacted by vibration. The fresh block is then transported to a place where the drying/curing process begins. The cure is done by spraying water over the blocks in order to ensure proper hydration of the cement and avoid that the blocks get ""burned"". The spraying is done for three days, three times per day. The blocks are then packed in pallets and stored.",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete,2022-01-01,2023-12-31,Ecuador,ecoinvent Data Quality System
