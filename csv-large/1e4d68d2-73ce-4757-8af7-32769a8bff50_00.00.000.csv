Inventory refers to 1 kg woven Jute textile The process involves winding, beaming, weaving, and calendaring. Cut pieces and threads are produced as byproducts, however, in a negligible amount.;The process starts with arrival of yarn to weaving section, beaming process follows when spool winding ends. To improve the quality of woven cloth and weaving efficiency, the wrap yarns are coated with sizing (starch paste). Adequate moisture is essential in this process. Weaving involves interlacement of two sets of threads, called ""wrap"" and ""weft"" yarns, to produce the fabric of desired quality, followed by damping (done manually) in which the rolled woven cloth is unrolled, and water is sprinkled on it continuously to provide desired moisture. After damping the damped fabric passes through pairs of heavy rollers, which renders the threads in fabric, flattened and improves the quality and appearance (calendaring). The last step is lapping in which Hessian fabrics are folded into the required size used in ""Bale press"" operation on the lapping machine. ;This inventory is a weighted average from data in India and Bangladesh.

The activity starts with reception of Jute yarn.


This activity ends with 1 kg jute textile as the final product of the weaving process.",00.00.000,Sector: Textiles,2016-04-01,2023-03-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
