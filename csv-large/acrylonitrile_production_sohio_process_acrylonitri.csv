The process is highly selective, requiring no recycling to produce high acrylonitrile yields of approximately 0.8 – 0.9 kg from 1 kg of propene. Acetonitrile (0.02 – 0.11 kg) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN, 0.15 – 0.20 kg) are the principal byproducts (from 1 kg propene). The heat of reaction can be recovered as high-pressure steam.;The catalyst used in the early Sohio process was a bismuth – phosphomolybdate combination. Since that time there has been a continuous search for alternatives and for superior performance, resulting in patents by more than 30 companies. Sohio introduced Catalyst 21 (antimony – uranium) in 1967, Catalyst 41 (ferrobismuth – phosphomolybdate) in 1972, and Catalyst 49 (undisclosed) in 1978. All of these changes were aimed at improved efficiency and reduction in byproducts.;;Simplified diagram of the Sohio acrylonitrile process. a) Fluidized-bed reactor; b) Absorber column; c) Extractive distillation column; d) Acetonitrile stripping column; e) Lights fractionation column; f) Product column;The reactor effluent is cooled and scrubbed with water in a countercurrent absorber. The off-gas, consisting primarily of nitrogen, is vented. The reaction products remain in the aqueous phase. Acetonitrile is removed by extractive distillation. Crude acrylonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are distilled overhead while water and acetonitrile are removed from the bottom of the columns. In subsequent distillations, hydrogen cyanide is separated from wet acrylonitrile, the water content of the product is then reduced, and finally, nonvolatile impurities are removed.;Unused ammonia can be recovered as ammonium sulfate and then disposed of, but it commonly is vented to the atmosphere. Aqueous wastes containing cyanides, sulfates, and various organic byproducts must be disposed of by incineration or deepwell injection or be pretreated for subsequent biological waste treatment;Reference:;Lollak, P., Romeder, G., Hagedorn, F., Gelbke, H.: Nitriles.
