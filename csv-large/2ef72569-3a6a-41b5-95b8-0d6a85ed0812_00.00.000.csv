The grades of recovered paper are put on the conveyor to the pulper in the ratio mentioned in the recipe. In the pulper the blend of dry, baled paper is converted into a pumpable suspension of fibres. This is achieved by submerging the bales in water and agitating the mixture so that the paper is wetted and broken up to form a suspension. The pulp is then screened and cleaned. and may undergo a disperging treatment. The stock passes through one or two head boxes onto the paper machine, Wellenstoff can be a one ply or two ply product. Usually, a size press treatment with a starch solution is applied in-line on the paper machine in order to obtain sufficient strength and stiffness properties. The process ends with the production of corrugated board base paper.",00.00.000,Sector: Pulp & Paper,2021-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
