This is a market activity. In the case of services or immobile infrastructures, markets are connecting suppliers and consumers at a global level. For specific connections at regional level, direct links between the local producing activities and the local consumers are preferred. Transport or losses are logically not relevant for this type of products.;This is the market for  'printed wiring board mounting facility, through-hole mounting line', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the construction of a printed wiring board mounting facility, through-hole mounting line. The facility is an example of a THT mounting line, with a manual insertion of the components, followed by a wave solder machine. The total mass of the system is 1,600kg.  The process includes material, production efforts (material treatment processes) and infrastructure for the production of all the machineries used.  

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Electronics",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
