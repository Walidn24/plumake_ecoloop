(2020). First, the methanol feedstock, before being fed into the dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis reactor, is pumped, and heated to the expected operating conditions. Namely, the reaction takes place at 300°C and 1.65 bar, attaining a 90% methanol equilibrium conversion that resembles typical industrial yields and conditions.;Subsequently, the reactor outlet, consisting of a DME and methanol mixture, is fed into the methanol-to-propylene (MTP) reactor, filled with a ZSM-5 catalyst. In the reactor, the mixture is converted mainly to olefins, such as (1) ethylene; (2) propylene; (3) C4 olefins, (4) C5 olefins; and (v) higher hydrocarbons, ranging from C6 to C10 (such as hexene(s), heptane(s), octenes, nonene(s), and decene(s)).;The MTP reactor operates at 425°C and 1.65 bar, that ensures the high methanol/DME conversion to propylene, while the overall reaction scheme is exothermic. The released heat from the latter exothermic reactor is used in a Rankine cycle to generate electricity, which is consumed internally. Any excess of generated electricity is considered as a valuable by-product.  ;The MTP reactor outlet is then cooled to 40°C, where an aqueous and organic phase is generated, and fed into a flash unit to remove the aqueous phase. The gaseous organic phase is pressurized in a three-stage compression train, with intermediate cooling, at 28.2 bar. The compressed stream is fed into a distillation column where a mixture of C4-C10 hydrocarbons is obtained at the bottom. The top stream consists of ethylene, propylene, and water, and thus, water is removed with a second flash unit prior to the purification and separation of ethylene-propylene. The water-free stream is, finally, fed into a second distillation column where polymer-grade ethylene and propylene are obtained at the top and bottom, respectively. The condenser of the second distillation unit operates at temperatures below ambient (ca. -21°C) and thus, a cooling cycle with a R134a working fluid was considered.;;;References:;Daniel F.
