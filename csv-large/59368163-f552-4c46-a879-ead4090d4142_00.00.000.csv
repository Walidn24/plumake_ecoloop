The processes are distinguished mainly based on their catalyst use and regeneration. Propane dehydrogenation processes are highly selective, overall yields of propylene from propane up to 90 % are claimed.;The propane feed is admitted to a moving-bed catalytic reactor. In a continuous process, the dehydrogenation catalyst circulates through the reaction vessel before passing to a separate regeneration vessel where coke is removed from the surface of the catalyst by combustion in air. The regenerated catalyst is returned to the first reactor.;Propene is recovered by conventional deethanizer – depropanizer splitting.;An overall selectivity for propene of 89 – 91% is claimed.;The chemical reaction of the reaction is:;C3H8 --> C3H6 + H2;The reaction is catalysed by a platinum-based catalyst, due to lack of data the catalyst was neglected.;References:;Eisele P.,Killpack R.
