After the melting process in the furnace, the steel is cast into billets. These billets are processed by hot rolling into rebars and coils for reinforcing steel. Rebars have a diameter of 8-40mm and a length of 6-30m. Coils have a diameter of 8-16mm and weigh 1.7, 3.0 or 5.0. The average steel grade is B550 or B500 (550 or 500 MPa)",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,Austria,ecoinvent Data Quality System
