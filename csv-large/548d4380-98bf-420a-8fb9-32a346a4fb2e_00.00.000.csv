This dataset represents the impacts associated to 1 ha of land use change (LUC), split between change from annual cropland, perennial cropland, primary forest, secondary forest and grassland. This dataset is specific to the country and to perennial cropland.;The dataset further includes the (management practice specific) occupation impacts, i.e. the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and, when relevant, peat oxidation.

The activity starts with the consolidation of the country specific land use changes: land transformation from primary forest, secondary forest, existing annual cropland and existing perennial cropland, to perennial cropland.

Included processes: land use changes (in kg NPP0), C and N emissions due to soil occupation (i.e. SOC change and emissions from peat oxidation by drainage. 
This activity ends with the addition of land occupation-related inputs and emissions (C in soil or biomass, CO2 from air, gross energy, CO2 to air, CH4 to air and N2O to air)",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Land Use",2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Costa Rica,ecoinvent Data Quality System
