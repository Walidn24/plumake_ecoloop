This dataset represents the service of kiln drying of one m3 sawn softwood beam. The wood chip used in the process is considered to be supplied internally which are generated from slabs and sidings when sawing. Characteristics of the of wood chips to be burned: Dry wood density 440 kg/m3; the low heating value 3007 MJ/m3, humidity when burned is estimated to be around 50%, which is achieved after some weeks of drying in the storage. Air emission factors as well as the boiler efficiency represent average annual operation including start and stop (warm-up and shut-down). The boiler used is considered to be 300 kW and emission profile refers to the facility. Shrinkage ratio of between the moisture content of u=30% - 0% is 0.004 %/%.;The data was provided by and approved by the Swiss forest industry.;Within ecoinvent, three products - boards, beams and laths - are distinguished:

Kiln drying process starting from sawn softwood, at the sawmill site, assumed to lose some water before the start of the kiln drying process.

This activity ends with kiln dried softwood beam, at sawmill. The dataset includes kiln drying of wet wood assumed as u=60% down to u=20%, shrinkage and emissions associated with wood chip incineration. The dataset does not include air emissions released from the wood, as the emissions are assume to be comparable to emissions from natural drying during decomposition/rotting.",00.00.000,"Swiss brush-up completed,Sector: Wood",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
