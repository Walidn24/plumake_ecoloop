Please note that in contrast to ecoinvent v2, the two power plant types do not exist anymore as single datasets. Along with (Röder et al. 2004), lifetime of these power plants is assumed to be 150’000 full load hours. Whereas European hard coal power plants are assumed to be operated in mid-load mode with 4000 full load hours per year (corresponding to a lifetime of 37.5 years) (Röder et al. 2004), a capacity factor (average US) of 66% is documented (eGRID 2006), corresponding to about 5800 full load hours per year, or a lifetime of about 26 years.;Average installed technology.; - Share of installed capacity with desulfurisation 2% (rough estimation based on sulfur mass balance; - Average efficiency of desulfurisation installations: 92% (rough estimation based on Dones et al. 27; - Share of installed capacity with denitrification (primary and/or secondary installations): 73% (figure based on IEA 212 ); - Average efficiency of denitrification installations: 8% (estimation based on Dones et al. 27, p.128.
