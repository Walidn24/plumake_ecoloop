Based on stoichiometry, 0.27234 kg of magnesium are required as an input per kg of Hf Sponge and 1.06685 kg of magnesium chloride is produced as a byproduct per kg of produced Hf sponge. Because 0.02494 kg of MgCl2 is lost in the reduction and distillation step, 1.0419 kg of MgCl2 per kg of hafnium sponge are sent to electrolysis.;The magnesium chloride is then separated via electrolysis in order to recover the magnesium and chlorine through the following reaction: MgCl2 → Mg + Cl2. After refining, the magnesium is recycled and serves again as input to the reduction and distillation process, during which hafnium sponge is produced, while chlorine (after it is filtrated and purified) is recycled and sent back to the carbochlorination process as an input.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals; Chemicals,2020-01-01,2024-12-31,United States of America,ecoinvent Data Quality System
