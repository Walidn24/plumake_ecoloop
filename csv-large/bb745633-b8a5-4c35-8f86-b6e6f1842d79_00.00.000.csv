The clinker (90-95%) is ground with gypsum (3-5%) and depending on the type of cement and technical standard (NT-47.01 2017 Eqv EN 197-1) with other materials such as limestone (5 to 10%) to produce the Portland cement.;The production values for Portland cement, which include the amounts of clinker, limestone, silica sand, and gypsum, are derived from the historical annual production statistics of a specific cement plant in 2019. Although these values are lower than the standard in Tunisia, similar values were observed in other cement plant. It is important to highlight that silica sand and limestone serves as a substitute for clinker in the production of this particular Portland cement.",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete,2019-01-01,2023-12-31,Tunisia,ecoinvent Data Quality System
