This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of drinking water (potable water) from seawater reverse osmosis with conventional pretreatment using enhanced membrane modules and a two stages configuration. An enhanced membrane is a polyamide membrane of 40.9 m2 of active membrane surface and maximum operating pressure of 1200 psig (83 bars). Two stages allow higher recovery rate, but requires higher operation pressure. Thus, only enhance membrane can be used with this configuration. This dataset is based on published literature and on modeling. Reverse osmosis system was modeled using typical seawater characterisation, two stages enhance module membrane system with recovery rate of 55% and energy recovery by pressure exchanger of 40%. It includes water intake of seawater, conventional pretreatment, reverse osmosis filtration, recarbonisation and emissions of brine to sea. The modeling of the reverse osmosis treatment was done using the ROSA (Reverse Osmosis System Analysis) system design software from Dow Chemical. Recarbonation and post-treatment of permeate water are modeled with the Rothberg, Tamburini and Winsor (RTW) Model for Corrosion Control and Process Chemistry 4.0 by Tetra Tech. Typical seawater characterisation for salinity of 3.5% (w/w) was used for modeling. Composition is based on literature (Open University 1989). ;Open University (1989).

From intake of seawater. This dataset includes energy and material inputs for the different water treatment stages: chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, clarification, sedimentation of sludge, dual media filtration, cartridge filtration, membrane filtration and post-treatment. It includes material for the membrane module and pressure vessel assuming lifetimes of 5 and 15 years, respectively.

This dataset ends with the production of tap water, at facility gate. Electricity for lighting and heating the building  is excluded due to lack of data. Note that the energy for the pumps pressurizing water at the beginning of the network was estimated due to lack of data. It excludes energy for pumping stations and water losses within the network which is included in the tap water market. Emissions to the environment are limited to release of brine to the environment and carbon dioxide emissions from water under atmospheric conditions.
