This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, 1400kW thermal, components for electricity only', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the production of a heat and power co-generation unit, organic Rankine cycle, components for electricity only, with a thermal output of  1,400kW. The infrastructure is automatically supplied with wood chips, using a steam turbine and a multi-cyclone filter, while it has a lifetime of 80 years. The process includes a control cabinet and a electrical generator. 

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat; Electricity",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
