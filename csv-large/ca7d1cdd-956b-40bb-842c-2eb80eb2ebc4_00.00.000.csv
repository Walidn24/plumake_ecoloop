The sodium sulfite suspension formed is centrifuged and the salt dried. Some sodium sulfite is obtained from the scrubbing of SO2-containing off-gases. Production processes using an anhydrous route have not yet achieved industrial importance.,00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
