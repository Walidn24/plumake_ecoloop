In 2000, BP has started producing acetic acid using the Cativa process, which uses a promoted iridium catalyst package instead of the rhodium complex. (Jones, 2000);The operating conditions of this homogeneous catalytic carbonylation reaction (Monsanto process) spans from 30–60 bar and at temperatures of 150–200 °C and gives selectivity of over 99% based on methanol (Le Berre,2014). Methanol carbonylation in polar solvents is preferred (i.e., acetic acid/water solvent medium). A small amount of methanol may be loss due to side reactions with propionic acid as the main product. The carbon monoxide is lost in the reaction with water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Le Berre, C., Serp, P., Kalck, P. and Torrence, G.
