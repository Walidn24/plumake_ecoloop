This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas', in the Global geography.;This market contains no transport or losses, as they are irrelevant for the delivered product.;This product represents heat measured in MJ. The heat is produced through various other means than natural gas. This includes burning of biomethane in gas turbine; biogas in co-gen gas engine; anthracite, coal, lignite briquettes and coke in stove; hardwood, logs, softwood, wood chips, wood pellets in furnaces and wood heaters; light fuel oil in boilers. Also contributing are heat from heat pumps and solar collectors. The dataset is targeted for district and industrial-scale heating. 

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of  heat, district or industrial, other than natural gas', to the consumers of this product. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Heat",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
