This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for glued solid timber.; Glued solid timber beams are industrially-manufactured products for load-bearing structures. They comprise two or three coniferous wood planks or squared timbers which are glued together by their face sides parallel to grain.;The manufacturing process corresponds with that of glued laminated timber, whereby larger individual cross-sections are glued together. Thanks to their manufacturing process, glued solid timber beams are very dimensionally stable and are only susceptible to minor cracking.;Owing to their high dimensional stability and low moisture content glued solid timber beams are particularly suitable for timber-frame buildings. glued solid timber beams are manufactured from spruce, fir, pine, larch or Douglas fir. Other coniferous species are permissible but not typical.;The standard strength class is C24 or C24M;Reference:;Kollmann F. F. P., Kuenzi E. W. and Stamm A. J.
