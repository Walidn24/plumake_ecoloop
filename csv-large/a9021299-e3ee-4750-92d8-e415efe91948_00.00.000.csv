Inventory refers to 1 kg cocoons;This dataset represents the production of 65 kg of cocoons from 100 dfls (disease free layings). Sericulture is a well organised and to a large extent government supported activity in this region. It is promoted as a local revenue source for government and employment for the poor. Disinfected eggs are available at distribution centres where farmers can collect them at appropriate time and establish them at their rearing centres, where they have a mulberry garden adjacent to silkworm rearing hall (75 m2);Rearing room is thoroughly washed, along with equipment and disinfected, prior to silkworm incubation ( 15 days prior).  The required trays are arranged  the loose egg spread on lncubation Fames or egg sheers suitably spread and is covered with a polythene sheet and a sheer of black paper. Requisite temperature i.e., 27-28˚C and 80 %   relative humidity is maintained for incubation. Eggs hatch in 9 days and gives rise to Larva. Larva stage continues for 22-25 days during which it continues to consume mulberry leaves. After this period the larva begins to spin silk around itself and transforms to cocoon. The cocoons are collected and deposited at cocoon banks from where they are sent to reeling centres.;Total water requirement of the activity is 3.19 litre/kg cocoon, electricity requirement 2.46 kWh/ kg cocoon and 0.011 kg plstic tray, 0.0538 kg newspaper;Cocoon yields depend on silkworm variety, leaf quality and rearing conditions and are often expressed in kg of fresh cocoons per 100 disease free layings (DFL), equivalent to 40000 eggs.

Available at: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652614005939.);Average based on data collected from farmer at Guna district in the state of Madhya Pradesh (Central India). Data was also collected from Manager of District Cocoon bank, which is Government operated cocoon distribution centre. ;The result of this activity is 1 kg of silk cocoons from 0.65 dfls which is equivalent to 612 eggs.;Eggs are recirculated in the system and hence not considered as input here

Activities start from reception of eggs.


This activity ends with produced 1 kg  cocoons. The datasets includes use of water and disinfectants, mulberry leaves consumption, electricity consumption for heat and light, and plastic tray. Emissions from disinfectants are not modelled while potential N2O emissions from silkworms are modelled based in results from other insects.
