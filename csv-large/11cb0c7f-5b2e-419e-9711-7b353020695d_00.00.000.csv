The charge is weighed and loaded into a bin, which is taken to an enclosed room to mix the contents. The firing pot is prepared by ramming refractory sand mixed with water around a central former. After ramming the firing pot, the inner surface is coated with a weak binder solution and dried under a gas fired hood before being transferred to the firing station. The raw material mix is automatically fed at a controlled rate into the firing pot, where the exothermic reaction takes place. When the metal has solidified following the reaction, the firing pot is removed and transferred by crane to a cooling conveyor. On removal from the cooling conveyor (by crane), the firing pot is placed on a stripping bogie for transferral to a stripping booth. Inside the closed booth, the pot casing is hoisted off the solidified metal/slag. The slag is separated from the Chromium metal “button” and sent to a despatch storage area. Water is used to reduce button temperature to below 100 ºC. After cooling the metal button is transferred to other departments on site for cleaning, breaking, crushing and grinding to achieve the desired product size.;ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS;In the electrolytic process normally high carbon ferrochrome is used as the feed material which is then converted into chromium alum by dissolution with sulphuric acid at temperatures at about 200 ºC. After several process steps using crystallisation filtration ageing, a second filtration and a clarifying operation the alum becomes the electrolyte for a diaphragm cell. Chromium is plated onto stainless steel cathodes until it attains a thickness of ca. 3 mm. The process is very sensitive. The additional de-gassing (heating at 420 °C) stage is necessary because the carbon content of the electrolytic chromium is sometimes too high for further industrial applications. The cooled chromium metal is fragmented with a breaker prior to crushing and drumming. The generated slag can be reused as refractory lining or sold as abrasive or refractory material.;Overall emissions and waste: Emissions to air consist of dust and fume emissions from smelting, hard metal and carbide production; other emissions to air are ammonia (NH3), acid fume (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), VOC’s and heavy metals. Emissions to water are overflow water from wet scrubbing systems, wastewater from slag and metal granulation, and blow down from cooling water cycles. Solid waste is composed of dust, fume and sludge, and slag.;;References:;IPPC (2001) Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC); Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in the Non Ferrous Metals Industries.
