This is a linking activity. Several different noble gases (or their mixtures) can be used as an inert gas for gas-discharge lamps. This linking activity separate the production volume of argon which is later on used as inert gas in gas-discharge lamps and link it to the generic market for inert gas for discharge lamps.
