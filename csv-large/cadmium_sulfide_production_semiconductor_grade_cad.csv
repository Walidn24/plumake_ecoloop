This aqueous technique of producing CdS involves a number of handling steps and is a complex procedure. According to a patent, the normal procedure is to “dissolve a cadmium salt in water, preferably the chloride or sulphate, and then bubble hydrogen sulfide through the solution to precipitate essentially all of the cadmium in the form of cadmium sulfide.” The reported yield is quite high; anionic and cationic impurities co-precipitates with the cadmium sulfide. The following purification involves extensive washing and leaching, until a high purity of the output product can be obtained.;Reference(s):;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.
