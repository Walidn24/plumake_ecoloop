This dataset represents the treatment of non-exhaust emissions produced by road abrasion from road freight transport. The datasets are treatments because they represent a removal of substances from the technosphere (removal of tyre material).;;This dataset and the emission factors within it relate to 1kg road wear. It is valid for Europe and represents the average data for road freight transport. ;;Calculation of non-exhaust emissions (tyre, brake and road wear emissions) are based on EMEP/EEA (2013) and values for net vehicle weights and average load factors. Net vehicle weights are taken from the EcoTransIT (2011) report whilst the average load factors are taken from the Tremove model v2.7b (2009) and EcoTransIT (2011) report.  ;;The road wear emissions are to air only. All particulates are accounted for as emissions to air and have particle sizes below 100um. Anything above this does not remain airborne over longer periods.  ;;In order to use the treatment of non-exhaust emissions in a transport dataset the quantity of emissions per tkm must be calculated. This must then be devided by the specific load factor of the transport in question.Non-exhaust emissions are considered to be linearly scalable to gross vehicle weight (GVW). For road wear emissions from lorries the specific quantity is 7E-9 kg/kg GVW*km.;;Main data sources:;;De Ceuster, G., et al. (2009) TREMOVE: Final Report. Model code v2.7b, 2009.
