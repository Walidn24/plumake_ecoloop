Starch is sacharified in 60 degrees celcius and pH 4.5. The main enzyme present in this proces is glucoamylase in a concentration of  0.61 kg of enzyme per kg of dry matter substrate. The fermentation needs approximately 72 hours. The process consumes heat and electricity mostly to create ideal conditions for the enzymes.;Reference:;Jennifer B.
