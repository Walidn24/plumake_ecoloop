This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'furnace, wood chips, average storage area, 300kW', in the Global geography.;Transport from producers to consumers of this product in the geography covered by the market is included.;This is an immobile infrastructure, representing the product of a wood chips furnace that includes an average storage area. It has an assumed lifetime of 20 years for the furnace and the automatic control system, 80 years for the chimney, a capacity of 300kW and an operation time 2,100 h/year. A furnace of this capacity is used to heat a large building complex or to supply a smaller heat network. The process includes the most important materials used for the construction, their decommission, energy and heat for the construction and the decommission of the device.  

This activity starts with the built infrastructure ready to use.

This activity ends with the infrastructure made accessible to the users. Transport or losses are considered irrelevant for this product.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Heat",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
