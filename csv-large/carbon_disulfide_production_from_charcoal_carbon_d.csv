Reaction between the sulfur vapor and a stationary bed of charcoal at 850 – 900 °C takes place inside the retort at slightly above atmospheric pressure. The product gas, consisting of carbon disulfide, some sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and inerts, passes through a train of condenser, scrubber, and oil absorber where the crude carbon disulfide is recovered; the pure product is obtained by further treatment in distillation columns. The yields are below 90%.;Electrical resistance heating in brick-lined electrothermal reactors provides an alternative heat source for the reaction of charcoal with sulfur. Where cheap power is available, the electrical method may be more economic.;Figure: Methane process for CS2 production.;a) Reaction furnace; b) Catalytic reactors; c) Sulfur condenser; d) CS2 scrubber; e) CS2 condenser; f) CS2 absorber; g) Oil interchangers; h) CS2 stripper; i) Stabilizer column; j) Purification column; k) Caustic wash column; l) Water wash column;;Tables: World production of CS2 in 1984 in 103 tons / World production of CS2 in 1991 in 103 tons ;Lay, M., Sauerhoff, M., Saunders, D.:Carbon disulfide.
