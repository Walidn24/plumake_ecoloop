The hydrogentation of toluene is similar to the hydrogenation of benzene, with a yield of 95%. (Ullmann 2004). At the same time, the catalyst assumed is Raney nickel (50 % Ni, 50 % Al). As there was no data available for the heat requirments of the methylcyclohexane production, the values were estimated with data for the production of cyclohexane from the hydrogenation of benzene (Chauvel et al. 1989). At the same time, the electricity requirments of the toluene hydrogenations are based on the methylcyclohexane production of a plant in Germany (Wurster 1994).;Hydrogenation of toluene:;C7H8 + 3H2 --> C7H14;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed.;References:;Ullmann's encyclopedia of industrial chemistry (2004).;Wurster, R., Zittel, W.: Hydrogen Energy in: ""Energy technologies to reduce CO2 emissions in Europe: prospects, competition, synergy"", Conference Proceeding of the Conference held at Petten, 11-12 April 1994, OECD/IEA, Paris 1994.;Chauvel, Alain, Gilles Lefebvre, and L.
