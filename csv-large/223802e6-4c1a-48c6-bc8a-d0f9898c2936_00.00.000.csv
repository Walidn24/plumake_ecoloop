It is volatile in steam and forms azeotropes with biphenyl, butyl benzoate, catechol, diphenyl ether, diphenylmethane, and naphthalene. At 89.7 °C, a mixture of excess benzoic acid and water forms two stable liquid phases. The water content of the benzoic acid phase is 26.5 wt %. The two phases become homogeneous at 117.2 °C. The mixture then contains 32.34 % benzoic acid and 67.66 % water (Maki T. and Takeda K., 2000).;Reference:;Takao Maki and Kazuo Takeda: Benzoic Acid and Derivatives. Published online: 2000.
