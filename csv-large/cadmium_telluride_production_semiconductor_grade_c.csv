Harman (1985) reports the preparation of CdTe for substrates: “Elements are sealed in evacuated, carbon-coated quartz tubes. The capsule is placed in a single furnace which is initially in a nearly horizontal position. A slight tilt in the furnace keeps the liquid and solid material at the small diameter end of the tube. The temperature of the furnace is raised to its final temperature of about 1110°C, at the conical tip end approximately 100°C lower. The temperature of the growth tube is held for about 16 to 20hrs, then the furnace is rotated about 90° to a vertical position. After the temperature is stabilized, the tube is lowered at a rate of about 1.2mm/hr until the solution has completely solidified.”;Reference(s): ;Classen M., Althaus H.-J., Blaser S., Tuchschmid M., Jungbluth N., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M. and Scharnhorst W.
