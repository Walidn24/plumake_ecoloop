Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'lime, packed', in the geography of Europe without Switzerland.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the low share (in the range of 1.0%-5.5% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union.
