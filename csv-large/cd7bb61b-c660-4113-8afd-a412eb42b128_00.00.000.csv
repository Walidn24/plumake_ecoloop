This includes the gas lift process and deep-pump pumping (see Meili et al., 2023, chapter 3.1), as well as a default share of 15% enhanced oil recovery (EOR; described in section 4.2 of Meili et al., 2023). For the natural gas production, also the processing of the gas (e.g., drying and desulfurization) is considered.",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Fuels,2021-01-01,2023-12-31,Poland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
