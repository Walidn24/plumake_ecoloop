After the manufacture of electrodes, the production of cells includes cell assembly and finishing. Lithium ion batteries are manufactured in sets of positive electrode (i.e. LFP cathode) and negative electrode (i.e. graphite anode), piled one on top of the other and then assembled in cells. A separator, i.e. a porous membrane is located in between electrodes to allow the flow of lithium ions. Within the cells, lithium ions move from the cathode  into the liquid electrolyte through the micropores of the separator into the graphite anode during the charging phase. During the discharge of the battery, the Li+ ions move back into the cathode. ",00.00.000,Sector: Electronics,2018-12-31,2025-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
