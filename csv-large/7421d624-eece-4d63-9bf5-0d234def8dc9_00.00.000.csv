It is mined together with gypsum in open pit mining. The intermediate products are composed of about 65% natural gypsum (CaSO4 * 2 H2O), 34% natural anhydrite rock (CaSO4) and 1% soil and gravel that are deposited back in the mine.  The material is gained by blasting and digging. The output of the mine is crushed and sorted. Anhydrite rock is used by the cement industry; it has to be finely ground for use as cast plaster floor.
