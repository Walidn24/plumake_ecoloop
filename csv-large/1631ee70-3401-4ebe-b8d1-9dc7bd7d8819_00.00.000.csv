The exit gases contain maleic anhydride, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and traces of aromatics. 50-60% of the anhydride is obtained directly from the reaction gas mixture. The remainder is recovered in the form of maleic acid. The maleic acid is then converted to anhydride via dehydration, usually by distillation with xylene (Falcke et al., 2017). Off gases leaving the scrubber are sent to a catalytic incinerator (personal communication Lonza).;C6H6 + 4½ O2 -> C4H2O3 + H2O + 2 CO2;The reaction occurs at slightly elevated pressure and temperatures of 350 – 450 °C and 1.5–2.5 bar with residence times over the catalysts of about 0.1 s and an air excess. The oxidation reaction in modern plants is performed at higher concentrations of benzene in air, reducing the amount of air required by the process. This reduces the amount of electricity needed for the air compressor, which is the larger portion of the overall electricity consumption, according (personal communication Lonza).;Regarding the catalytic system, vanadium oxides are used on different promoters such as phosphorus and the oxides of Fe, Cr, Ti, Co, Ni, Mo (such as V2O5-H3PO4).;In this dataset, a yield of 88% was assumed, according to Wells (1999). The treated exhaust gas contains undreacted benzene and carbon monoxide, and thus, is being combusted. Please note that the catalytic system is not covered.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
