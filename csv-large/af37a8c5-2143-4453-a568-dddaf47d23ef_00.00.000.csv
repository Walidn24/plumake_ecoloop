This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'containerboard, fluting medium', in the Global geography.;Fluting medium id commonly not traded globally but rather on regional/local markets. This datasets was therefore introduced for the supply of regions which lack local production and markets of corrugated board boxes. Transport distances and modes were estimated based on the ecoinvent default transport assumptions. The estimated amount of transport via transoceanic ship was neglected, because intercontinental trade is not common for this type of product. Losses are assumed negligible for this type of product.;Containerboard is the umbrella term for two different types of board, linerboard and fluting medium, which are both required to produce corrugated board. Linerboard is a flat layer of board, which can be further distinguished in kraftliner and testliner, depending on whether it is of virgin or recycled origin, respectively. Fluting medium is the corrugated middle layer between a top and bottom layer of linerboard. Together all three layers constitute corrugated board. Virgin fluting medium is commonly called semichemical fluting, while recycled fluting can also be called wellenstoff.

The activity starts with the finished fluting medium.
