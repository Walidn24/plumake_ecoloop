The iron scrap is melted in the electric arc furnace and alloys (approximately 1% manganese (Mn), 0.2% silicon (Si) and in some cases microalloy (for example 0.01% vanadium (V)). After the melting process in the furnace, the steel is cast into billets. These billets are processed by hot rolling into rebars and coils for reinforcing steel. Rebars have a diameter of 8-40mm and a length of 6-30m. Coils have a diameter of 8-16mm and weigh 1.7, 3.0 or 5.0. The average steel grade is B550 or B500 (550 or 500 MPa).",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,Austria,ecoinvent Data Quality System
