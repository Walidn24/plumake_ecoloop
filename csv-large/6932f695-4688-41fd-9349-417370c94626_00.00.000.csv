At first, peracetic acid is formed from oxygen and acetaldehyde. Subsequently, the peracetic acid reacts under suitable conditions with a second molecule of acetaldehyde to form acetic anhydride and water:;CH3CHO + O2 → CH3CO3H;CH3CHO + CH3CO3H → C4H6O3 + H2O;An additional reaction takes place, where the intermediate product (peracetic acid) decomposes by water to produce acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, as follows:;CH3CO3H + H2O ⇌ H2O2 + CH3CO2H;Therefore, acetic acid is co-produced along with the acetic anhydride product.;The operating conditions of this production process are as follows: pressure at 2-3 bar and temperatures kept between 40-60°C. Besides, at higher temperatures acetic anhydride decomposes rapidly. The strong exothermicity of the reaction creates the need for efficient cooling. At the same time, ethyl acetate is used as diluent (regenerated and recycled), and is mixed with acetaldehyde in the ratio of 2:1. Several other diluents can be used, such as methylene chloride, diisopropyl ether, cyclohexane, alkyl benzoates, and alkyl phthalates. Notably, the catalytic system (which could be regenerated) along with the rapid removal of generated water is crucial in this process. Some suitable catalysts are the following (i) mixtures of manganese acetate and copper acetate, (ii) of cobalt acetate and nickel acetate, (iii) and of cobalt and copper salts of higher fatty acids. In general, the acetaldehyde and diluent mixture is introduced with the addition of 0.05 to 0.1 % cobalt acetate and copper acetate at 40 °C; the ratio of Co:Cu is 1:2.;The reactor outlet is fed into a water-cooled condenser, and subsequently, the dehydrated mixture is sent to a distillation collumn system where acetic anydrite is recovered and unreacted acetaldehyde is reclaimed and recycled to the reactor. Finally, the off-gases are flared.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed for the production of (i) the peracetic acid and (ii) the acetic anhydride. For the decomposition of the anhydride to acetic acid a yield of 100% was assumed.;References:;Held, H., Rengstl, A., Mayer, D.: Acetic anhydride and mixed fatty acid anhy-drides.
