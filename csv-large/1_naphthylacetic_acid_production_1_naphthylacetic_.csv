A yield of 90% was assumed.;C10H8+C2H3O2Cl+KBr(cat) -> C12H10O2+HCl+KBr(cat);Chemical, organic is used to proxy naphthalene.;Sodium hydroxide is added to neutralize the formed hydrochloric acid. The catalyst in not consider significant in terms of emissions for the reaction and it is therefore not included in the dataset.;Reference(s):;Ogata Y., Ishiguro J., (1950). J. Am. Chem.
