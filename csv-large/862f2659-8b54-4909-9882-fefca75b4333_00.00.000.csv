The nitriles are isomerized to 3-and 4-pentenenitriles in the following step. In the final step, the pentenenitriles are hydrocyanated a second time in an anti-Markovnikov fashion to produce adiponitrile. The reactions are catalysed by a copper halide catalyst, this catalyst in not consider significant in terms of emissions for the reaction and it is therefore not included in the dataset.;C4H6 + HCN --> C5H7N;C5H7N + HCN --> C6H8N2;Reference(s):;Musser, M.
