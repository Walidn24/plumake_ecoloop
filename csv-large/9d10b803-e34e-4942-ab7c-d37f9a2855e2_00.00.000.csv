Lithium ions move from the cathode (NCA) into the electrolyte through the micropores of the separator into the silicon coated graphite anode during the charging phase. During the discharge of the battery, the Li+-ions move back into the cathode. ",00.00.000,Sector: Electronics,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
