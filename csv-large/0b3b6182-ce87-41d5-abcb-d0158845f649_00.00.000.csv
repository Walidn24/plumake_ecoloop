This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for soft wood fibreboard. Soft fibreboard, also called softboard or wood insulation board is an engineered wood product in conformity with the standard EN 13171. Soft fibreboard consists of up to 85% of wood fibres which have been produced in either the dry or the wet process from wood residues from sawmills (e.g. sidings) and from wood chips. When produced in the dry process, it is also called low density fibre board. Softboard is applied for building shell like roofs, walls and floors, acting as thermal and acoustic insulating material. Softboard regulates moisture balance permitting fully vapour permeable construction which avoids the risk of interstitial condensation or rot without the use of membranes or vented cavities. Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics.

Activity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.

Activity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2019-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
