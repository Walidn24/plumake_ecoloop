For esterquat (cationic tensids) at least one ot the alkyl residues must be longer.;For this dataset, representing typical European production mix in the mid 90s, the cationic tensides are produced by esterification of triethanolamines and subsequent quaternation with dimethylsulphate. Isopropanol is used as solvent. Fatty acids used for the esterification step are from tallow.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling",1992-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
