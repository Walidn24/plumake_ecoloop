This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This market represents the mix of land tenure 'land tenure, arable land, measured as carbon net primary productivity, pasture, man made', in Brazil, Santa Catarina. This is land that is made accessible for cultivation after deforestation, transformation from primary or secondary forest, or change from annual to perennial crops (or vice versa), and is used by activities modelling land use change only.;The production volumes and market shares of land tenure and LUC have a high level of uncertainty, which can have large impacts in overall LCIA results (Novaes et al. 2017). However, the uncertainty associated with these data could not easily be reflected in the datasets. Uncertainty assessments should take this limitation into consideration.

Activity starts with the delivery of land for cultivation from the different activities.

Activity ends with the provision of arable land to activities modelling land use change.",00.00.000,Sector: Land Use,2017-01-01,2023-12-31,"Brazil, Santa Catarina",ecoinvent Data Quality System
