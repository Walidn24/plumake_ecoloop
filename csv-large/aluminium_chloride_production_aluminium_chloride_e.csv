Notably, the alluminum could be sourced as a scrap, secondary ingot or prime ingot (Kirk et al. 2004). Chlorine gas is blown in baths of aluminium melt using cylindrical reactors with ceramic lining (Lee et al. 2011 and Helmboldt 2007). This reaction is exothermic with a heat delta of 1.41 MJ/mol, the reaction requires temperatures between 670 to 850 degrees Celsius.;Chemical reaction:;2Al + 3Cl2 -> 2AlCl3;The product sublimes through the melt pool and subsequently condenses into a vessel where it also solidifies on the condenser walls. The generated crystals of aluminium chloride are periodically removed, processed, and packed under a dry air or nitrogen atmosphere (Kirk et al. 2004). The hot gas that exits the melt pool is filtered to remove entrained liquids and solids, while the off-gases are purified before recycling.;In this dataset, a yield of 95% was assumed, with a 95% recirculation for the remaining 5% of unreacted aluminium. Finally, the residual alluminium was assumed to be sent for landfill.;Reference(s):;Lee, D. et al. 2011. CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS OF ALUMINUM CHLORIDE (AlCl3) BY COST-EFFECTIVE REDUCTION PROCESS.
