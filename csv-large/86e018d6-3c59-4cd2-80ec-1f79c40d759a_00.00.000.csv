Notably, the amount of alkoxylation species can be varied to achieve different chain lengths and molecular weights.;In more detail, the process takes place in a batch mode, where an initiator and a base (catalyst) are first introduced. The role of the initiator and the catalyst is generate an alcoholate-anion, subsequently the epoxide is introduced and the reaction operates at approximately 100 - 130 Â°C at a pressure within the following range 2 - 5 bar. The reaction is strongly exothermic, and thus, the cooling of the reactor is important to maintain the temperature level within the latter range.;Finally, the long chain polyether polyol product has to be purified i.e. separated from the spent catalyst, which takes place through the introduction of an acid which reacts with the base (i.e., catalyst) to form an insoluble salt which is easily removed by filtering.;References:;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of long and short chain polyether polyols for polyurethane products",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2026-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
