The cells are placed in the module and the terminals of adjacent cells are connected either mechanically or by laser welding. The top and bottom of the module is left open to allow air to flow between the cells to cool them.;Reference:;Nelson, P. A., Gallagher, K. G., Bloom, I. D., & Dees, D. W. (2012).
