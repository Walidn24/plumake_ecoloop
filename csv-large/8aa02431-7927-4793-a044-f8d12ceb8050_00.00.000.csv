Sand is the only product from this process, even though gravel can be extracted, it is not recovered. Suction Hopper Dredger (autonomous vessels that perform all stages of sand mining, i.e., extraction, loading, transport, and unloading) is considered. Extraction and loading stages are executed by centrifugal pumps powered by diesel engines. The pumps dredge the sand from the riverbed, along with water, clay, silt, and gravel, are extracted, forming the slurry. This fluid is pumped through the pipeline up to the vessel top where it is poured into steel sieves. Coarse materials (gravel, leaves, and sticks) are retained by the sieves and are returned to the river. The rest of the slurry (sand, water, and mud) falls into big chambers inside the vessel. Sand decants faster from the slurry, due its density and size, and deposits at the chamber’s bottom. Most of the water overflows from the vessel to the river, carrying a great amount of the mud (silt and clay). Auxiliary suction pumps drain water surplus of the sand to lower the cargo weight.;After completing the extraction and loading stages, the same vessel transports the dredged sand until loading ports. The pulp is then pumped to the loading port by pipelines to semi-closed chambers at the loading port. Sand deposits at the bottom of the port’s chambers, water returns to the river carrying part of the fines. Some companies may sort the sand by grain size in this stage. In the end, Sand is washed to clean the fines and is transported by heavy equipment to storage piles.;Dredged sand from alluvial deposits can generate several local environmental issues. Problems related with changes in the natural sedimentation process, erosion of margins, changes in the stream bed conditions, changes in the suspended sediments of river water and even problems related with local and regional sand availability. “Continued and indiscriminate sand mining not only changes the physical characteristics of the river basin environments, but also disturbs its closely linked flora, fauna, and human life” (PADMALAL; MAYA, 2014);None of these problems were assessed in this dataset due the lack of data, but they should be taken in consideration.;For further information, please refer to Padmalal, D. & Maya, K., 2014.
