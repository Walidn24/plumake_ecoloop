This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the global market for plywood. It is not specific to a type of plywood by number and height of the wood layers, but represents a generic product.;Plywood is made out of glued veneers. Veneers are thin sheets of wood obtained by sawing, cutting, or peeling. ;Reference:;Kollmann F. F. P., Kuenzi E. W. and Stamm A. J. (1975) Principles of Wood Science and Technology.
