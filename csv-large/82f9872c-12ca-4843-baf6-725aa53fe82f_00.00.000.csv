The seedlings are produced in an unheated greenhouse and packed for transport.;The seedlings go with a packaging of 1.05 kg of growing dras (HDPE), 3.65 kg of plant boxes from cardboard and 0.0525 kg of strech wrap (LLDPE), to be recycled or disposed of after planting

The activity starts with the establishment of the greenhouse with HDPE film and considers soil improvement, fertilization, transport of inputs and transport packaging materials.The dataset also contains the disposal of the transport packaging (after plantation of the seedling).

The activity ends with the seedlings packed for transportation. The dataset does not contain data on water use, frame infrastructure of the greenhouse and on the use of fungicides, insecticides etc. as source does not provide this information.",00.00.000,Sector: Forestry,2002-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
