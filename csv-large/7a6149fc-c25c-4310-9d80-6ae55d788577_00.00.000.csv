For large methanol synthesis plants, Lurgi has introduced a two-step combination (combined reforming process) that gives better results. In the primary tubular reformer, lower temperature (ca. 800 °C) but higher pressure (2.5-4.0 MPa instead of 1.5-2.5 MPa) are applied.;More recently, Lurgi developed another two-step gas production scheme. It is based on catalytic autothermal reforming with an adiabatic performer and has economic advantages for very large methanol plants. At locations where no carbon dioxide is available most of the methanol plants are based on the following gas production technologies, depending on their capacities: steam reforming for capacities up to 2000 t/d or combined reforming from 1800 to 2500 t/d (Ullmann 2001).;Methanol produced using a low-pressure steam reforming process (ICI LPM) account for approximately 60% of the world capacity (Synetix 2000a). Besides steam reforming, combined reforming has gained importance due to the production of methanol in large plants at remote locations. ;The reaction of the steam-reforming route can be formulated for methane, the major constituent of natural gas, as follows:;Synthesis gas preparation:;CH4 + H2O → CO + 3 H2; ΔH = 206 kJ mol-1;CO + H2O → CO2 + H2; ΔH = - 41 kJ mol-1;Methanol synthesis:;CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH; ΔH = -98 kJ mol-1;CO2 + 3 H2 → CH3OH + H2O; ΔH = -58 kJ mol-1;For an average plant the total carbon efficiency is around 75%, 81% for the synthesis gas preparation and 93% for the methanol synthesis (Le Blanc et al. 1994, p. 114). For steam reformers usually a steam to carbon ratio of 3:1 to 3.5:1 is used.;As methanol production is a highly integrated process with a complicated steam system, heat recovery and often also internal electricity production (out of excess steam), there were only data of the efficiency and energy consumption of the total process available. Therefore, the process was not divided into a reforming process, a synthesis process and a purification process for estimating the energy and resource flows. Also, the energy and resource flows in the methanol production plants are site specific (dependent on the local availability of resources such as CO2, O2, or electricity). ;In this dataset, typical values for a methanol plant, where methanol is prepared from natural gas through a single train of combined reformers. Namely, the most important units are the following: the conventional steam methane reformer (SMR), followed by an oxygen blown autothermal reformer (ATR), and the methanol synthesis and purification stage, yielding AA grade methanol. Finally, auxiliary inputs and process steps are also covered in this datasets, e.g., infrastructure, feedstock pre-treatment and catalytic system(s), among others, ;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
