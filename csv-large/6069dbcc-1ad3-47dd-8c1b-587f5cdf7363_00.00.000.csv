They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for 'cement, II/A' in the Global geography.;In this market, expert judgement was used to develop product specific transport distance estimations.;The product 'cement, II/A' represents cement (CEM II/A), also known as Portland-limestone cement or Portland composite cement. It covers the representative production mix of CEM II/A-D, CEM II/A-LL and CEM II/A-S according to EN 197-1. This product is made of clinker and 6-20% alternative constituents (weight-%). Alternative constituents may include limestone, granulated blast furnace slag, silica sand (max. 10%), pozzolan, flue ash or burned slate. Portland composite cement is used for the production of concrete.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'cement, CEM II/A' within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'cement, CEM II/A'  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete,2005-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
