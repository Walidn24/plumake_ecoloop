The chopper mainly consists of unalloyed steel plates and has a total weight of 2.5 t.;The chopper contains 5 litre of gear lubricant oil, which is exchanged every 4'000 service hours or 13'000 piled m3. This gear lubricant oil is inventoried as “Fuel oil petro, at storehouse CH”. The cutting knifes weight 5 kg, a service life of 2'000 h or 6'500 piled m3 and consist of low-alloyed steel. For the production of the chopper it is assumed that 25 MJ/kg primary energy for unalloyed steel and 35 MJ/kg primary energy for low-alloyed steel must be used. Primary energy resources are 50% electricity and 50% gas. ;Reference:;Etienne (1993) Personal communication. Etienne AG, Luzern.
