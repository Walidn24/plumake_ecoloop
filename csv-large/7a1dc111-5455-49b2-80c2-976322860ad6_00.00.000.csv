This dataset is a weighted average of the regional datasets, with weights based on production volume of the reference product.  Detailed comments and sources about the exchanges can be found in the regional datasets.;The geographicalCorrelation score of every pedigree matrix of was changed to '5'.;Sum of regional production volumes: 9.624e+9 kg;ES: PV = 6.460e+9 kg; weight = 0.6712;IT: PV = 3.164e+9 kg; weight = 0.3288;Yield of the global dataset = 4783.27265716 kg/ha, calculated as a weighted average of the regional yields.;The comments below were part of the ES regional dataset.;This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of olives. The average yield from 2009 - 2012 is 5 t/ha. The data are representative for olive production in Spain (Andalusia) used for the export market. Mineral NPK fertiliser input is 60-60-60 kg/ha. No organic fertilisers are applied. Total active ingredients (a.i.) applied as pesticides amount to 2.15 kg a.i./ha.;The dataset was modelled within the project 'World Food LCA database (WFLDB)'. The aim of this project was to provide inventories of a broad variety of agricultural products and processes and to cover for each product at least 50% of the global export market. The share of olives produced in Spain amounts to 37% of the global production (tonnage produced in 2010). The production system regarded in this dataset aimed at representing olives produced in Spain for the export market.;PEF-Quality: data quality rating (DQR) = 1.5 (i.e. excellent quality). This dataset refers to an average situation; for specific situations exchanges might differ substantially due to site specific parameters

This activity starts with the nursery producing fruit tree seedlings, i.e. grafted young trees to be planted.

This activity ends with the waste treatment after the clearing of the orchard (rooting up the trees). The dataset includes all activities of a year in a year in the productive phase of the orchard including the establishment phase per year of lifetime (40 years, 250 trees/ha planted), the clearing of the orchard including waste treatment. 
The establishment phase of the orchard includes tree nursery, soil cultivation, planting trees, sowing grass, and irrigation. Fertiliser and pesticide use in a year of the establishment phase is assumed to be half of the amount of a year in the productive phase.
The productive phase of the orchard includes machine operations, corresponding infrastructure, fuel use and sheds. Machine operations in the productive phase are: soil cultivation (mulching, mowing), fertiliser and pesticide application, harvesting and irrigation. Further, direct field emissions and land use change are included. At the end of the productive phase the orchard is cleared by rooting up the trees.
Heavy metal uptake by the crop is considered. The inputs of seedlings, fertilisers and pesticides as well as packaging of fertilisers and pesticides are considered.",00.00.000,"WFLDB,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2001-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
