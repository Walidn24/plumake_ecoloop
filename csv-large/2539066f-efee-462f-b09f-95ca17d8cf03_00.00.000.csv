The dataset is based on data from standard plant in Switzerland in the  year 2006, a plant with methane recovery in the stock.;The average Swiss plant in the year 2006 was determined by evaluating 20 plants producing about 50% of the electricity from agricultural biogas plants. A typical Swiss plant has a concrete fermentation system and offers the possibility to treat co-substrates. ;Compared to the data given for the plants without covering the following differences occur:;because of the larger volume the major material used, like concrete or reinforcing steel, are use in larger quantities; because of the coverage a bigger amount of rubber is used.;A schematic plant design is given below:",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2004-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
