This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'hydrogen fluoride', in the Global geography.;Special transport modelling for liquid gases of a dangerous nature: No ship transport and normal transport modelling for chemicals reduced by 70%.;;hydrogen fluoride'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007664-39-3. It is called 'fluorane' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: FH. It is gas under normal conditions of temperature and pressure with a strong, irritating odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'hydrogen fluoride',  within the geography of Global.

This activity ends with the supply of 'hydrogen fluoride',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
