This dataset represents the imported electricity from wind power, from DE to AT to the market for renewable energy products CH. The import value includes all electricity imports, independently whether used within the importing country, or re-exported. For a discussion of different ways of modeling electricity trade in LCI, please refer to (Itten & Frischknecht 2012).

This activity represents the point of ""handing over"" the electricity from one country to the other at the border.

This dataset doesn't include any electricity losses or transmission infrastructure as these are accounted for in the market datasets. ",00.00.000,Sector: Electricity,2010-01-01,2023-12-31,Switzerland,ecoinvent Data Quality System
