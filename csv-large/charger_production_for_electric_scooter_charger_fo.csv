This dataset describes the production of a charger suitable for an electric scooter. The entries are given as a function of kg of device. The original data was collected for a device of approximately 3 kg weight. The dataset is based on direct inspection of existing commercial devices of current technology.

The dataset takes as input the various electronic components required to build the charger and includes the components' production efforts. Assembly energy not included due to lack of data.

The dataset returns the assembled device and production waste as a by-product.",00.00.000,Sector: Electronics,2005-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
