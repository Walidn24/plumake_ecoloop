Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  'sewage sludge', in the geography of Switzerland.;It is assumed that most of the waste produced in Switzerland is also treated in Switzerland, that is why a regional Swiss market is created for the treatment of sewage sludge.
