In this activity we assume enzymes are produced from potato starch along with a bacterial strain. The bacterial strain is ommited leaving the enzyme production based only on potato starch as input. It is assumed that 4.16 kg of potato starch are needed to produce 1 kg of enzymes (Lages and Tannenbaum 2006). Heat and electricity required for the production are taken as the average of the values reported in Dunn et al. (2012) as inputs for the production of the following three enxymes: Alpha-amylase; Glucoamylase; Cellulase.;Reference(s): ;Dunn et al. 2012.
