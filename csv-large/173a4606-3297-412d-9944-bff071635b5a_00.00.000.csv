Open pit mining requires extensive drilling and blasting to reach load deposits. Ores are removed from the mine and transported to milling and beneficiating plants for concentrating the ore. Concentration, or beneficiation, is carried out by disintegration, washing and classification in the size fractions in large sizes, At Emet Colemanite Concentration plant (Turkey), a colemanite ore of 27% B2O3 content is treated to produce a concentrate having 43% B2O3. ;Reference:;Ã–nal, G., & Burat, F.
