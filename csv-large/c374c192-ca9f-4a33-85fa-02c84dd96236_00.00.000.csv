The mixture is preheated before passing into an esterifying column where it is refluxed and some of the distillate removed overhead. The mixture, containing about 20% of the ester, goes into a second refluxing column where a ternary azeotrope (consisting of 83% ethyl acetate, 9% ethanol and 8% of water) is removed overhead at a temperature of about 70Â°C.;An equal volume of water is mixed with the distillate after which it separates into two layers. The bottom layer is fed into a separator column and ester is recovered as a ternary azeotrope. Any alcohol remaining in the bottom layer is vaporized and recycled to the esterification column.;The upper layer, containing around 93% ethyl acetate together with some water and ethanol, passes to a refluxing column where it is mixed with sufficient ester to ensure that the water and ethyl alcohol are removed as a ternary azeotrope overhead. The residue in the column, consisting of 95% ethyl acetate, is redistilled to remove any impurities. The process leads to a yield of 99 %.;Reference:;Wells, G.
