For example, nitric oxide or nitric acid can be hydrogenated catalytically to hydroxylamine. For the reduction of nitrous acid to hydroxylamine, sulfurous acid is used. In all cases the product is an aqueous solution of a salt NH2OH • HX (where HX is an acid, e.g., sulfuric or phosphoric acid) or (NH3OH)X, rather than free hydroxylamine. Acid hydrolysis of primary nitroalkanes, with simultaneous formation of the corresponding carboxylic acid, plays only a minor role in the production of hydroxylamine.;;Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitric Oxide;To produce nitric oxide of high purity, ammonia and oxygen are reacted together over a platinum–rhodium catalyst at a temperature above 900 °C, the reaction gas being diluted with enough water or water vapor to bring the mixture below the lower explosion limit.;The byproduct, nitrogen dioxide, and excess oxygen are subsequently hydrogenated over a silver catalyst to nitric oxide and water, respectively.;After condensation and simultaneous recovery of water vapor, nitric oxide is purified in a washer and converted to hydroxylamine by reaction with hydrogen below 50 °C over a suspension of partially poisoned platinum catalyst in sulfuric acid. Small amounts of ammonium sulfate and dinitrogen monoxide are produced as byproducts.;;A continuous multistep process, in which the exhaust gases are extensively recirculated, has proved itself industrially. Residual gas, composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, nitric oxide, and dinitrogen monoxide, can be burned for recovery of steam. Explosive gas mixtures can be avoided in the synthesis of hydroxylamine by the choice of suitable gas composition.;Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitrates;In the hydroxylamine –phosphate –oxime (HPO) process hydroxylamine is produced by hydrogenation of ammonium nitrate solution in phosphoric acid in combination with synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime for production of caprolactam. This process is described in  Caprolactam.;;The Raschig Process;The Raschig process, sometimes modified, remains an important process for the production of hydroxylamine.;Water, ammonia, and carbon dioxide react together in an absorption column to give a solution of ammonium carbonate, which forms an alkaline solution of ammonium nitrite with nitrogen oxides at low temperature. In a further step, the ammonium nitrite is converted to ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate with sulfur dioxide. In this process, excess ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate is recycled. The ammonium hydroxylamine disulfonate solution is drawn off and the salt is hydrolyzed and neutralized to give hydroxylammonium sulfate and ammonium sulfate as products.;;Acid Cleavage of Nitroalkanes;Mixtures of nitropropane and nitromethane can be cleaved to hydroxylammonium sulfate and the corresponding carboxylic acid by sulfuric acid at elevated temperature. This process has been used only to a limited extent because of its cost and the limited availability of raw materials.;;Production of Crystalline Salts;Catalytic hydrogenation of nitric oxide leads to solutions of hydroxylammonium salts, which, after removal of the hydrogenation catalyst and neutralization with ammonia if required, can be allowed to crystallize. The Raschig process leads initially to an oxime; acid hydrolysis, removal of the ketone, and subsequent crystallization give the solid salt.;With the intregrated hydroxylamine–cyclohexanone oxime process for production of caprolactam, the solid salts are also, in principle, accessible by acid hydrolysis of the oxime.;Reference:;Ritz, J., Fuchs, H. and Perryman, H.
