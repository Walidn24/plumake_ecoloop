Purified and saturated brine (25-28 wt.-% NaCl in water) is fed to the electrolysis cell on top of a film of mercury (Hg) flowing down the inclined base of the cell. The base of the cell is connected to the negative pole of a direct current supply forming the cathode of the cell. Anodes consisting of titanium coated with oxides of ruthenium and titanium are placed in the brine without touching the mercury film. At the anodes, chlorine gas is formed which is collected and directed to further processing. Due to a high overpotential of hydrogen at the mercury electrode, no gaseous hydrogen is formed; instead, sodium is produced and dissolved in the mercury as an amalgam (mercury alloy). The liquid amalgam is removed from the electrolytic cell and fed to a decomposer, where it reacts with demineralised water in the presence of a graphite-based catalyst to form sodium hydroxide solution and hydrogen. The sodium-free mercury is recirculated back into the cell. Cooling of hydrogen is essential to remove any water and mercury. The sodium hydroxide solution is very pure, almost free from chloride contamination and has usually a concentration of 50 %. Further treatment comprises cooling and removal of catalyst and mercury traces by centrifuges or filters. Advantages of the mercury cell process are the high quality of chlorine and the high concentration and purity of sodium hydroxide solution produced. The consumption of electric energy for electrolysis is, however, higher than for the other techniques and a high purity of the feed brine is required. Inherently, the use of mercury gives rise to environmental releases of mercury.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Global,ecoinvent Data Quality System
