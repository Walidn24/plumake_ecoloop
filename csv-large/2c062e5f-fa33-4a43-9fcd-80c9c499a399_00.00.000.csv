During wet mining, floating dredges and a floating concentrator are utilized in an enclosed pond, where the concentrator moves behind the dredges. Wet mining is the preferred technique for large continuous deposits with amounts of clay. ;For all other types of HMS deposits (hard-ground deposits, discontinuous deposits and small tonnage high-grade deposits), dry mining is the most preferred mining process. Dry mining utilizes earth-moving machinery (loaders, excavators, scrapes) for the purposes of sand excavation and transportation to the concentrator. The mining unit plants used in dry mining are mobile in order to minimize the transport distance of the sand. ;After the transportation of the HMS to the respective concentrator, wet gravity separations techniques (spirals) are usually applied for the production of the heavy mineral concentrate (HMC), although some hard-rock sites use bulk froth flotation to extract the heavy minerals from the sand. The produced slurry from dry and wet mining is then fed to the concentrator, where the HMC (90-96% heavy minerals) is produced along with the tailings that are backfilled in the mined areas. The HMC is transported to a mineral separation plant (MSP), where the HMC is subjected to scrubbing, drying and is separated by magnetic, electrostatic and gravity separation, producing zircon sand, ilmenite and rutile, with the last two considered as byproducts.",00.00.000,Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Australia,ecoinvent Data Quality System
