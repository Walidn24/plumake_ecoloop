Carbamates are produced by reacting a chloroformate with an amine. If a thiochloroformate is used instead the product is a thiocarbamate.; ;The dataset [thio]carbamate-compounds was calculated from the arithmetic mean of all inputs and outputs of the production of asulam, carbetamide, desmedipham, orbencarb, pirimicarb, and prosulfocarb.;;Asulam is produced in five steps from aniline:;C6H7N + C2H4O2 → C8H9NO + H2O;C8H9NO + ClSO3H → C8H8ClNO3S + H2O;C8H8ClNO3S + NH3 → C8H10N2O3S + HCl;C8H10N2O3S + C2H3ClO2 → C10H12N2O5S + HCl;C10H12N2O5S + NaOH → C8H10N2O4S + C2H3O2Na;Precursors that are used for the asulam production are chlorosulfonic acid (ClSO2OH) and methyl chloroformate (C2H3ClO2).;;Carbetamide is produced in five steps from acetaldehyde:;C2H4O + HCN → C3H5NO;C3H5NO + HCl + 2 H2O → C3H6O3 + NH4Cl;C3H6O3 + CH4O → C4H8O3 + H2O;C4H8O3 + C2H7N → C5H11O2N + CH4O;C5H11O2N + C7H5NO → C12H16N2O3;Precursors that are used for the carbetamide production are ethylamine (C2H7N) and phenyl isocyanate (C7H5NO).;;Desmedipham is produced in six steps from nitrobenzene:;C6H5NO2 + H2SO4 → C6H5NO5S + H2O;C6H5NO5S + 3 H2 → C6H7O3S + 2 H2O;C6H7NO3S + 3 NaOH → C6H6NONa + Na2SO3 + 2 H2O;C6H6NONa + H2SO4 → C6H7NO + NaHSO4;C6H7NO + C3H5ClO2 → C9H11NO3 + HCl;C9H11NO3 + C7H5NO → C16H16N2O4;Precursors that are used for the desmedipham production are phenyl isocyanate (C7H5NO) and ethyl chloroformate (C3H5ClO2).;;Orbencarb is produced in two steps from diethyl amine:;C4H11N + COS → C5H11NOS;C5H11NOS + C7H6ClBr → C12H16ClNOS + HBr;Precursors that are used for the orbencarb production are carbonyl sulfide (COS) and 2-chloro benzyl bromide (C7H6ClBr).;;Pirimicarb is produced in six steps from ethyl acetate:;2 C4H8O2 → C6H10O3 + C2H6O;C6H10O3 + H2O → C4H6O3 + C2H6O;C4H6O3 + CH3I → C5H8O3 + HI;C5H8O3 + C2H6O → C7H12O3 + H2O;C7H12O3 + C6H20N6SO4 → C8H14N3O + C2H6O + H2O + H2SO4;C8H14N3O + C3H6ClNO → C11H18N4O2 + HCl;Precursors that are used for the pirimicarb production are dimethylcarbamoyl chloride (C3H6ClNO), N,N-dimethyl guanidine sulfate (C6H20N6SO4), and methyl iodide (CH3I).;;Prosulfocarb is produced in three steps from propanal:;2 C3H6O + 2 H2 + NH3 → C6H15N + 2 H2O;C6H15N + CCl2O → C7H14ClNO + HCl;C7H14ClNO + C7H8S → C14H21NOS + HCl;A precursor that is used for the prosulfocarb production is benzyl mercaptan (C7H8S).;;Precursors:;;Benzyl mercaptan (C7H8S) is produced in two steps from hydrogen sulfide:;H2S + NaOH → NaSH + H2O;NaSH + C7H7Cl → C7H8S + NaCl;;Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is produced from carbon monoxide and sulfur:;CO + S → COS;;2-Chloro benzyl bromide (C7H6ClBr) is produced in two steps from toluene:;C7H8 + Cl2 → C7H7Cl + HCl;C7H7Cl + Br2 → C7H6ClBr + HBr;;Chlorosulfonic acid (ClSO2OH) is produced from hydrogen chloride and sulfur trioxide:;HCl + SO3 → ClSO2OH;;Dimethyl carbamoyl chloride (C3H6ClNO) is produced from phosgene and dimethyl amine:;C2H7N + CCl2O → C3H6ClNO + HCl;;N,N-Dimethyl guanidine sulfate (C6H20N6SO4) is produced in four steps from calcium carbide:;CaC2 + N2 + O2 → CaCN2 + CO2;CaCN2 + CO2 + H2O → CH2N2 + CaCO3;C2H7N + CH2N2 → C3H9N3;C3H9N3 + H2SO4 → C6H20N6SO4;;Ethylamine (C2H7N) is produced from ethanol and ammonia:;C2H6O + NH3 → C2H7N + H2O;;Ethyl chloroformate (C3H5ClO2) is produced from ethanol and phosgene:;C2H6O + CCl2O → C3H5ClO2 + HCl;;Methyl chloroformate (C2H3ClO2) is produced from methanol and phosgene:;CH4O + CCl2O → C2H3ClO2 + HCl;;Methyl iodide (CH3I) is produced from methanol and iodine:;10 CH4O + 5 I2 + 2 P → 10 CH3I + 2 H3PO4 + 2 H2O;;Phenyl isocyanate (C7H5NO) is produced from anilinie and phosgene:;C6H7N + CCl2O → C7H5NO + 2 HCl",00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Chemicals; Agriculture & Animal Husbandry",2000-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
