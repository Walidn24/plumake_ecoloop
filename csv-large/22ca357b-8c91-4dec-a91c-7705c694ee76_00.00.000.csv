This is a market activity, representing a treatment mix. In the case of products needing treatment, market mixes are supplied by the activities treating the product in the geography defined by the market, and they supply the activities needing to treat the product, as they have generated it as a by-product in the Undefined processes (present as a negative input in system models). Transport to the treating facility or losses are also accounted in this type of markets, when relevant.;This is the market for  'sulfidic tailings, from copper mine operation', in the geography of Chile.;This dataset represents the conveyance of 1 kg of sulfidic tailings generated in a copper mine, from the location in the mine where they are produced to the tailings impoundment.

This activity starts at the copper mine in the geography CL, where the tailings are generated.

This activity ends with the deposit of 1 kg of sulfidic tailings in the tailings impoundment. The energy and equipment required for pumping the tailings into the tailings impoundment are not included, as they should be taken into account in the mine operation activity.",00.00.000,Sector: Waste Treatment & Recycling; Resource Extraction; Metals,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Chile,ecoinvent Data Quality System
