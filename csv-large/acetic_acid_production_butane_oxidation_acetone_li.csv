About 43 kg of formic acid is produced per ton of acetic acid. Unreacted hydrocarbons, volatile neutral constituents, and water are separated first from the oxidation product. Formic acid is separated in the next column; azeotropic distillation is generally used for this purpose. The formic acid contains about 2 wt % acetic acid, 5 wt % water, and 3 wt % benzene. Formic acid with a content of about 98 wt % can be produced by further distillation.;Reference:;Gräfje, H., Körnig, W., Weitz, H.-M., Reiß, W.: Butanediols, Butenediol, and Butynediol, Chapter 1.
