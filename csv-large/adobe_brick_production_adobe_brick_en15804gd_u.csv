The manufacturing process includes the reception of raw materials, dosing, mixing, forming, drying, and storage of adobe bricks. The overall process applied in Ecuador implies that a selection of 2 or 3 types of clay is prepared, and mixed with straw and rainwater. The mix is made with the help of the trampling of a horse, then placed in a wooden mold with the shape of a brick (forming process, done by hands). The material in excess on the surface is taken away and reused for the next brick. The mass in the mold is left to dry under the sun. No electricity powered machine nor heat are used during the whole process. ",00.00.000,Sector: Cement & Concrete,2022-01-01,2023-12-31,Ecuador,ecoinvent Data Quality System
