In fact, European Commission 2001 shows, that the distillation unit is the most frequently used unit operation within the production of a big variety of organic chemicals. Its data is therefore taken as basis for the estimation of the composition of the whole unit operation infrastructure (incl. storage facilities) in this datset. ;Concerning the efforts for the manufacturing and installation of the different parts, only information about the production of the distillation unit is available from the above mentioned reference. According to the infrastructure, it is assumed again, that these data are representative for the all unit operations infrastructure. For the installation efforts of the pipes, it is assumed due to a lack of respective data half the amount from the distillation unit per kg of pipes.;Furthermore, it is assumed that the control units (electronic equipment) have about 5% of the weight of the total unit operation infrastructure. The image above summarizes the composition of the different parts of the facilities and the respective production efforts. Concerning the electronics equipment, its production and composition is described in detail in the dataset 'electronics production, for control units'.;;In KAM 2001 there is an example for the weight distribution between pipes (incl. supporting structure) and unit operation infrastructure. Similar information can be calculated, based on information of BASF . The following table summarizes all this information and shows the values used in this dataset.;*)	Data source: [A]: Jungbluth 2007, [B]: KAM 2001, [C]: assumptions according to text, [D]: assumption, based on in¬formation in KAM 2001;References:;Jungbluth N., Chudacoff M., Dauriat A., Dinkel F., Doka G., Faist Emmenegger M., Gnansounou E., Kljun N., Spielmann M., Stettler C. and Sutter J.
