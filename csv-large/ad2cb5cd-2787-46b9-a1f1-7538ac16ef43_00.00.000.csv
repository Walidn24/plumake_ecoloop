This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the European market for cement-bonded particle board. This product belongs to the group of wood-based materials with mineral binder that consist of 30-90% of a hardened inorganic binder and 10-70% of wood particles. Because of the high binder content, these materials are heavy and particularly suitable for use in building. Mineral-bonded boards are characterised by low thickness swelling through the action of water. All mineral-bonded wood-based construction materials are categorised as building materials of low flammability because of their high binder content. Cement based boards are highly resistant to mould and termites. Cement-bonded boards are used mainly for exterior applications because of their high resistance to weathering. Transport distance based on eurostat transport statistics.

Activity starts with the product leaving the factory gate, ready for shipment.

Activity ends with the reception of the product at the consuming entity. Average transportation requirements from producer to consuming entity are covered.",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2019-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
