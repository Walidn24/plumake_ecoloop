In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors. The module operation of goods trains comprises both; the actual performance of goods trains as well as required shunting processes. A distinction between the type of traction, diesel and electricity is important since in most European countries diesel and electro locomotives are in operation for both goods transportation and passenger transportation. With the transport performance factors, one may calculate the specific energy consumption per tkm. The typical diesel consumption of 0.68g/tkm for shunting has been added to the specific energy demand (see also version 2 report 16 ""Documentation of changes implemented in ecoinvent Data v2.1 and v2.2"" (2010) section 7.2.2 ""Operation of Goods Trains in selected European countries (Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Belgium)""). Iron emissions to soil are accounted for employing the figure for Swiss operation services. Emission of lubricates due to traction are not accounted for, since measures are in operation to avoid such emissions.",00.00.000,Sector: Transport,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,France,ecoinvent Data Quality System
