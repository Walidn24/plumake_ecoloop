Therefore pore forming media are not included in tile-production.;To have the roof tiles coloured often engobe  is used. The amount of one company in Switzerland is about 3.6g/kg burned tile. The composition of engobe is confidential and therefore it cannot be taken into account in this study. More than 50% of the waste water from cleaning of the engobe equipment is usually reused as mixing water for the wet process to plastify the clay. Solid waste is deposited in the mine and waste water is supplied purified to the municipal waste water treatment.
