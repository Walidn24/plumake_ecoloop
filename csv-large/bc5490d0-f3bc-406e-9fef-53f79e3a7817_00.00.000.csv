Lithium ion move from the cathode (LiMn2O4) into the electrolyte (LiPF6 in ethylenecarbonate) through the micropores of the sepeartor into the anode (lithium ion intercalation). During the charging phase. During the discharge of the battery the Li+-ions move back into the cathode. ,00.00.000,"ConvertedDataset,Sector: Electronics",2009-01-01,2023-12-31,China,ecoinvent Data Quality System
