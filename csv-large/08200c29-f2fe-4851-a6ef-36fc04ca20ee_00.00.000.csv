In general seam thickness ranges from 2 to 10 meters; the seams are located up to a depth of 100 meters. In hard coal opencast mines often lorries and bucket excavators are used. Due to the fact that hard coal is embedded in hard rock formations and hard coal itself is rather hard, the rock formations have to be blasted, thus significant amounts of explosives are required.; ;;In this dataset it is assumed that the total amount of coal is treated, particularly for export coal high calorific values and low sulfuric contents are required. Data regarding mine waste is based on Hinrichs. ;;In this dataset a processing efficiency factor of 95 % (opencast mining) and 92 % (underground mining) is assumed. Mine waste is partly recycled or disposed. Energetic use of flotation tailings in fluidized bed combustion is not included in the dataset due to insufficient information and insignificant amounts; assuming complete utilization, only 20 % of combustible matter can be recycled.;;;References:;Hinrichs W., Atmaca T., Neumann W., Thormann A.
