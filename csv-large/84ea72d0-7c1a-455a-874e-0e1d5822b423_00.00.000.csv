The data of the energy use and combustion emissions represent a barge tanker navigates in inland waterways (strecht of water, not part of the sea) and with the capacity of not less than 50 tonnes. The fuel used is exclusively diesel. Exhaust emissions from inland waterway vessels - predominately powered by diesel engines - are characterized by similar emission profiles as diesel engines of heavy duty vehicles. For heavy metal emissions are employed the same figures as for hevy-duty vehicle diesel engines.  ",00.00.000,Sector: Transport,1998-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
