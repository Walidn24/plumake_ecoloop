Saturated brine flows through the anode compartment, where chlorine gas is produced at the anode. The electric field in the electrolysis cell causes hydrated sodium ions to migrate through the membrane into the cathode compartment. The cathode compartment is fed with diluted sodium hydroxide solution. Water is electrolysed at the cathode releasing gaseous hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, which combine with the sodium ions and thus increase the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the catholyte. Typically, the outlet concentration of sodium hydroxide is around 32 wt.-%. A part of the product stream is diluted with demineralised water to about 30 wt.-% and used as catholyte inlet. In some units, a more diluted 23 wt.-% NaOH solution is produced. In these cases, the inlet concentration is adjusted to 20-21 wt.-%. Usually the NaOH solution is evaporated to the marketable concentration of 50 wt.-% using steam. Depleted brine leaving the anode compartment is saturated with chlorine and is therefore sent to a dechlorination unit to recover the dissolved chlorine before it is resaturated with salt for recirculation. The advantages of the membrane cell technique are the very high purity of the sodium hydroxide solution produced and the comparably low energy demand. Disadvantages comprise the high requirements on brine purity, the need for sodium hydroxide evaporation to increase concentration, and the comparably high oxygen content in the produced chlorine. In general, multiple cell elements are combined into a single unit, called electrolyser, of whom the design can be either monopolar or bipolar. In a monopolar electrolyser, the anodes and cathodes of the cells are connected electrically in parallel, whereas in the bipolar design, they are connected in series. Therefore, monopolar electrolysers require high current and low voltage, whereas bipolar electrolysers require low current and high voltage. Since bipolar systems allow higher current densities inside the cells, investment and operating costs are usually lower than for monopolar systems.;References:;Euro Chlor (2013) An Eco-profile and Environmental Product Declaration of the European Chlor-Alkali Industry, Chlorine (The chlor-alkali process).",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,"Canada, Qu√©bec",ecoinvent Data Quality System
