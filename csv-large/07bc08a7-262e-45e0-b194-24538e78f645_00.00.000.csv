This method is sometimes called trickle irrigation and involves dripping water onto the soil at very low rates from a system of small diameter plastic pipes fitted with outlets called emitters or drippers. Water is applied close to plants so that only part of the soil in which the roots grow is wetted, unlike surface and sprinkler irrigation, which involves wetting the whole soil profile. With drip irrigation water, applications are more frequent (usually every 1-3 days) than with other methods and this provides a very favourable high moisture level in the soil in which plants can flourish.;Drip irrigation is mainly applied in intensive cultivations planted in rows (vegetables, fruit trees, melons, bananas, papayas, flowers, grapes, etc.). It is not recommended for potatoes, salad leafy vegetables, groundnuts, alfalfa and other dense planted crops, although it can be applied successfully (FAO, 2007).",00.00.000,Sector: Agriculture & Animal Husbandry,2015-01-01,2023-12-31,Peru,ecoinvent Data Quality System
