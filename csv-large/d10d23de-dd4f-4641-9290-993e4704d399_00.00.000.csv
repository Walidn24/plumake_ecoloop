These strands retain the natural strength properties of the wood and are critical to the quality of the finished product. The dry strands are metered into the blender where they are tumbled into a rotating drum with a fine mist of wax and resin. The resin/wax bonds the strands in the pressing process and enhances the moisture resilience of the board. The coated strands are then conveyed overhead to the forming line where a ""mat"" of flakes is laid on a continuous belt conveyor by a cut-off saw. This mat is loaded in a press where, under high temperature and pressure, a sheet of OSB is formed. In the finishing area the product is trimmed and cut to produce the finished OSB board. Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: oriented strand board particle, board or fibreboard.",00.00.000,Sector: Wood,2012-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
