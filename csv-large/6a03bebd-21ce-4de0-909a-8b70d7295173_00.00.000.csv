In th wet process, the raw material is grinded and then mixed into a mash with up to 98% water. This mash is then formed into a so-called fibre cake. After pressing most water out of the mat, the fibre cake is the cut and dried in the drying channel with temperatures between 160 to 220 Â°C. The addition of binders is usually not required, as the heating of the liquid lignin as part of the wood bonds the fibres during cooling. For special purposes (higher strength, hydrophobic properties), resins or bitumen-containing agents can be added.;Production is subject to the regulations of the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU-IED, 2011) if the production capacity exceeds 600 m3 per day where one or more of the following wood-based panels are produced: fibreboard, particleboard or oriented strand board.",00.00.000,"Swiss brush-up completed,Sector: Wood",2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
