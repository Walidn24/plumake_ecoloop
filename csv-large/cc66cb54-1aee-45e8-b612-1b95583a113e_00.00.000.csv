It is a reaction of ethylene with chlorine and hydrogen fluoride which takes place in a single step in a fluidized-bed reactor. A suitable catalyst is a combination of aluminum chloride and other metals.;2 C2H4 + 10 Cl2 + 11 HF â†’ C2ClF5 + C2F6 + 19 HCl;The hydrochloric acid is neutralized with sodium hydroxide.;Commercial production of chlorofluoroalkanes is also possible by the electrochemical fluorination process developed by Phillips Petroleum.;Impurities are usually removed from organic fluorine compounds by fractional distillation, fractional crystallization, or chromatographic methods. This does not apply to fluoropolymers and high-boiling perfluorinated oils, which require special measures, i.e., the use of extremely pure starting materials.;Quantitative determination of fluorine is possible in most cases by combustion and subsequent analysis of the hydrogen fluoride generated. Wet chemical methods are used to determine fluoride ions.;Because of the high volatility of organic fluorine compounds, purity can be readily determined by gas chromatography. 19F-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a valuable tool for determining the structure of organic fluorine compounds. Structure determinations, even of mixtures, are often easier using this method than with 1H-NMR spectra due to the larger chemical shifts of 19F-NMR spectra. The 19F signals can be integrated and used for quantitative analysis.;Chlorofluoroalkanes (and also the alternative HCFCs and HFCs) produced on an industrial scale are subject to stringent standards. Impurities must not exceed the following limits: ;Siegemund, G., Schwertfeger, W., Feiring, A., Smart, B., Behr, F., Vogel, H., McKusick, B.: Fluorine Compounds, Organic. Published online: 2002.
