The reference unit is 1 m3 wastewater input. This activity represents the treatment of a specific wastewater in a WWT plant (while direct emissions and sewering are heeded in the upstream market dataset for this wastewater). The size of the treatment plant infrastructure is for a supranational region average territory situation. The assumed size of the WWTP treats 104 Mio m3 per year. The mixture of WWTP with one, two, or three stages is 19.1%-63.1%-17.9%. The actual, waste-specific oxygen requirement in the biological stages is 3.345kg O. The generated waste-specific raw sludge is treated with anaerobic digestion. The digestion process produces 498.4 litres of biogas with an energy content of 9.399MJ. 24.1% of the biogas is utilized for energy. The remainder is flared. The gross electric efficiency is 0%. The gross thermal efficiency is 0%. The mixture of final sludge disposal to agriculture, landfill, or incineration is 100%-0%-0% (based on dry mass).
