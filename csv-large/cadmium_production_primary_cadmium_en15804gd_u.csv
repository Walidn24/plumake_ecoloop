Cadmium cathodes are formed by electrowinning. Other sources from pyrometallurgical zinc wastes and post consumer scrap (batteries) are disregarded.;OXIDATION & PURIFICATION;Cadmium is extracted by oxidizing the enriched starting materials solutions, remnants of hydrometallurgical zinc refining. In order to oxidize the cadmium, air is blown in . Cadmium is precipitated from the solution as a metal sponge by reduction with zinc dust. The precipitated sponge contains 90 % cadmium and only 2.5 % zinc. No heat is used for drying.;ELECTROWINNING;The cadmium sponge is precipitated directly in the tank with the electrolytic acid. The anode consists of lead, which does not dissolve, whereas the cathode is aluminum sheet. The current yield is ca. 93 %; the energy consumption is 1250 kWh per tonne of cadmium cathode sheet deposited. Typical impurity levels in electrolytic cadmium sheet are 5 - 10 ppm Cu, 15 - 20 ppm Pb, 5 - 10 ppm Tl, and 5 ppm Zn. The zinc dust used for cementation of the cadmium sponge is recovered later in the sludge of the electrolysis and will be returned into the zinc cycle.",00.00.000,Sector: Metals,2000-01-01,2023-12-31,"Canada, Qu√©bec",ecoinvent Data Quality System
