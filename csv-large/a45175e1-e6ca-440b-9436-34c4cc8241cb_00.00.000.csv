For this dataset, only the first production technique is taken into consideration, as it is the most widely used synthesis method. The overall reaction is the following:;H2NCH2CH2NH2 + 4 CH2O + 4 NaCN + 4 H2O → (NaOOCCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2COONa)2 + 4 NH3;With this production method, very high yields (> 90%) can be achieved. The by-product ammonia is usually boiled off during the reaction (Hart 2000).;For this dataset, a process yield of 95% is assumed. The inventory is based on stoechiometric calculations. The emissions to air (0.2 wt% of raw material input) and water were estimated using mass balance. Treatment of the wastewater in an internal wastewater treatment plant is assumed (elimination efficiency of 90% for C).;Reference:;Hischier R.
