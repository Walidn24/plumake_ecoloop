Net production is the gross production minus about 1% losses. Additionally there is energy needed for pumping. The efficiency of a pumped storage hydropower plant is around 70% (p.14 in Bauer et al. 2007).",00.00.000,"hydro power,Sector: Electricity",1945-01-01,2023-12-31,Romania,ecoinvent Data Quality System
