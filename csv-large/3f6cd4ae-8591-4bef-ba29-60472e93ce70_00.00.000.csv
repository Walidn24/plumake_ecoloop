Several of these processes use shallow basins, where water is evaporated naturally during hot weather. In a second step, the precipitated minerals containing sodium sulphate are then taken out of these basins for further treatment. Another possibility is the use of floating dredges for the mining of permanent deposits of sodium sulphate containing rock. No data were available for any type of exploitation of natural sources of sodium sulphate. Thus, the following assumptions are used:;- The overall yield for the sodium sulphate minerals is assumed to be 95% - thus per kg of sodium sulphate, from natural resources, 1.05 kg of sodium sulphate minerals is needed.;- For the first step (evaporation of water from a brine of sodium sulphate minerals) no environmental burdens are taken into account.;- For the further treatment, the energy consumption is approximated by the energy consumption for the sodium chloride production. Besides the energy, no further input is taken into account. Concerning emissions to air and water, it is assumed that 50% of the surplus input of sodium sulphate is eliminated in the water and 50% is eliminated within the inert waste that is assumed to be landfilled.;- Infrastructure: As no specific information is available, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from a large chemical plant.;References:;Althaus H.-J., Chudacoff M., Hischier R., Jungbluth N., Osses M. and Primas A.
