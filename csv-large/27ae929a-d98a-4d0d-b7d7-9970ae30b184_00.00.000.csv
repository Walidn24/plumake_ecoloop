For technical details of the different installation components see in the particular infrastructure datasets. The construction process of flat-roof installations is the following way: The different parts of the mounting system are delivered to the construction site. Most of the mass is the gravel for the foundation. The gravel would also be necessary for flat roof without a PV plant. Insulating mats, aluminium profiles and smaller parts are the main parts of the mounting system. First;the flat roof is cleaned from sand and gravel. A mat made from recycled plastic is attached for the protection of the roof. Than a foundation is made and fixed with loose gravel placed on this plastic sheet. Aluminium profiles are mounted and the panels are fixed to this foundation.",00.00.000,"infrastructure,photovoltaic power,Sector: Infrastructure & Machinery; Electronics; Electricity",2008-01-01,2023-12-31,Rest-of-World,ecoinvent Data Quality System
