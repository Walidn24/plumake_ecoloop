In the following water leaching & chlorine conversion process, the produced RE sulfates are leached and converted to 92% mixed RE chlorides, with a conversion efficiency of 97%. Afterwards, solvent extraction is applied to the mixed RE chlo-rides by mixing them with an organic extractant such as di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid, with the small differences in basicity of the different RE metals serving as the driving agent of the separation process. The products of the solvent extraction process are aqueous solutions of individual RE ions high purity (99%). The generated RE ions are then precipitated in the aqueous solutions to produce RE carbonates. Calcination of the RE carbonates at 750−800 °C with natural gas as the heat source is the final step to form the individual REOs (lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, neodymium oxide and a mixed samarium-europium gadolinium concentrate).",00.00.000,"combined production,Sector: Resource Extraction; Metals",2017-01-01,2023-12-31,"China, Inner Mongol (内蒙古自治区)",ecoinvent Data Quality System
