In order to account for the fact that the same rail tracks are used for both passenger and goods transportation are applied allocation factors. For the USA, according to (Facanha & Horvath 2006) it can be assumed that US freight trains for coal transport are all operated using diesel engines. The new dataset “transport, freight train, diesel/US/tkm” (Tab. 7.80) is based on the existing European freight transport by train (“transport, freight train, diesel/RER/tkm”). Instead of the average European share of electric and diesel freight train transport, only diesel as fuel is used.
