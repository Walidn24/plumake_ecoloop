The synthesis of 2-butyne-1,4-diol, based on the work of Reppe and his coworkers, is carried out by reaction under pressure of acetylene  and an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, catalyzed by copper acetylide. In 1984 over 95 % of the world production of butane-1,4-diol was based on the Reppe synthesis                                                                                              1,4-Butanediol is made on a large industrial scale by continuous hydrogenation of the 2-butyne-1,4-diol over modified nickel catalysts. The one-stage flow process is carried out at 80 – 160 °C and 300 bar according to .;An aqueous solution of 2-butyne-1,4-diol (30 – 50 %), together with carbon monoxide-free hydrogen and recycled reaction mixture, which acts as medium for dissipation of heat, is lead over a reduced nickel – copper – manganese catalysts on silica gel strands. The initial temperature in the reactor is 80 °C; the temperature must not exceed 170 °C. In order to obtain a better distribution of the liquid, hydrogen is also circulated.;The raw product contains methanol, propanol, and butanol as byproducts as well as traces of 2-methyl-butane-1,4-diol, hydroxybutyraldehyde, acetals, and triols. The reactor effluent is worked up to pure butane-1,4-diol by fractional distillation.;;;a)Piston pump; b) Preheater; c) Hydrogenation reactor; d) Gas – liquid separator; e) Recycle compressor;  f) Canned motor pump; g) Hydrogen compressor; h) Air cooler;Reference:;Gräfje, H., Körnig, W., Weitz, H.-M., Reiß, W.: Butanediols, Butenediol, and Butynediol, Chapter 1.
