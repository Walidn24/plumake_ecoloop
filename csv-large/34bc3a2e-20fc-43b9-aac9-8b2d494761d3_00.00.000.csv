Hence, plants may start the production of TDI with either toluene or the respective mixture of DNT isomers. ;Nitration of toluene: C6H5CH3 + 2 HNO3 --> C7H6N2O4 + 2 H2O;A hydrogenation step follows, where the DNT mixture is converted to diaminotoluene (TDA) isomers.;Hydrogenation of dinitrotoluene: C7H6N2O4 + 6 H2 --> C7H10N2 + 4 H2O;;The corresponding TDA mixture is subsequently treated with phosgene to produce a TDI isomer mixture in solution, along with HCl byproduct.;Toluene diamine phosgenation: C7H10N2 + 2 COCl2 --> C9H6N2O2 + 4 HCl;In absence of phosgene in the form of a raw material, this intermediate is produced on-side from carbon monoxide and chlorine.;Phosgene production: CO + Cl2 -->  COCl2;The solution is then purified via distillation, in which the 80:20 TDI isomer composition is maintained. Finally, a fractionation step is carried out, which yields a stream with 100% 2,4-TDI and another stream with a 65:35 mixture of 2,4- and 2,6-TDI isomers.;References:;2021, ISOPA , Eco-profile of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) , 3 - SeparatePublication",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2020-01-01,2026-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
