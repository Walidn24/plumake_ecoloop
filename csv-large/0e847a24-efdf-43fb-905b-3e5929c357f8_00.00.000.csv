This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This is the market for  'sulfur dioxide, liquid', in the geography of Europe.;Special transport modelling for liquid gases of a dangerous nature: No ship transport and normal transport modelling for chemicals reduced by 70%.;;sulfur dioxide, liquid'  is an inorganic substance with a CAS no. : 007446-09-5. It is called 'sulfur dioxide' under IUPAC naming and its molecular formula is: O2S. It is gas with a biting odour. The substance is modelled as a pure substance.  There is no publicly available information about the consumption of this substance on a consumer level. On industrial sites, the substance is used for the manufacture of products in the following sectors: chemicals, metals, food products, mineral products (e.g. plasters, cement) and pulp, paper and paper products.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce 'sulfur dioxide, liquid',  within the geography of Europe.

This activity ends with the supply of 'sulfur dioxide, liquid',  to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2011-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
