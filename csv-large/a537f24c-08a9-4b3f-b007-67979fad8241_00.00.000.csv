One of the Argentiean nuclear power plants (Embalse power plant) is a 600 MW Canadian design (CANDU 6) which uses the system of pressurized tubes.The other two PHWRs (Atucha 1 and Atucha 2) use presurized recipients instead.  This dataset is based on the CANDU 6 technology. Some emission data were extrapolated from other nuclear technology.
