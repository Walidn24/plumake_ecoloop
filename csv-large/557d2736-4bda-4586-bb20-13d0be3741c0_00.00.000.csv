Digestion is performed with NaOH solution in the case of wolframite concnetrate and Na2CO3 solution in the case of scheelite concentrate in order to obtain a sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) solution. The sodium tungstate solution is purified by filtration and precipitation. Precipitation of dissolved silicates is carried out by adding aluminum sulfate solution or magnesium sulfate solution. Molybdenum and other elements forming insoluble sulfides (As, Sb, Bi, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Co) are precipitated by the addition of an excess of sodium hydrosulfide and acidification with sulfuric acid. Finally, the purified Na2WO4 solution is converted to ammonium tungstate solution using solvent extraction and APT is formed by crystallization;Furberg, A., Arvidsson, R., Molander, S., 2019.
