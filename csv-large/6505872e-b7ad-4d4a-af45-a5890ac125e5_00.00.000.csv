This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant.;This dataset represents the supply of 1 kg of benzaldehyde from activities that produce it within the geography RER.;A regional market for Europe [RER] is motivated by the relatively low share (in the range of 8.0%-13.1% of total trade quantities between 2010-2016) of import quantities to EU28 from outside (excluding Norway and Switzerland) the Union. In addition, the export quantities exceeded the import quantities (the ratio export/import was in the range of 0.1-7 in the same period). Source: Eurostat database, EU trade since 1988 by HS6Â (DS-016893), HS6-code: 291221 - BENZALDEHYDE, Assessed on: 2018-01-31.;The transport amounts are based on eurostat transport statistics for 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database, extracted on the 2018-06-01). See exchange comments for additional details.

This activity starts at the gate of the activities that produce benzaldehyde within the geography RER, with the product ready for transportation.

This activity ends with the supply of 1 kg of benzaldehyde to the consumers of this product. Transport is included. Product losses during transportation are assumed negligible and are therefore not included.",00.00.000,Sector: Chemicals,2018-01-01,2023-12-31,Europe,ecoinvent Data Quality System
