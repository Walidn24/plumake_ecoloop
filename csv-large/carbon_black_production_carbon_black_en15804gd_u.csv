The oil-furnace process is, according to Voll and Kleinschmit (2010) and Dannenberg and Paquin (2000) a partial combustion process of liquid aromatic residual hydrocarbons.;The principle is to atomize the feedstock into the reactor, where it is decomposed into carbon black and hydrogen due to the fact that the oxygen available is not sufficient for a combustion of all the input. The reactor temperature is in the order of 1200 to 1900 °C, achieved through the combustion of natural gas and of the unreacted feedstock. After the decomposition, a fast quenching has to be done to avoid the loss by reaction of carbon black with carbon dioxide and water. The further processing consists mainly of drying and separation from other substances like tail gases, through a filter system.;This dataset describes the production of carbon black with the oil-furnace process, using natural gas as further energy input. The inventory is based on literature information about two different types of carbon black, as well as estimations based on industrial data. The emission amount is estimated while the composition is based on literature.;References:;Voll, M. and Kleinschmit, P. 2010. Carbon, 6. Carbon Black.
